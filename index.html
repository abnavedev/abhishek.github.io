<p class="noindent">This book is intended for Civil Services aspirants for whom not only knowledge, but also a well-planned strategy is important to conquer the examination. When they have a well-defined goal like cracking the Civil Services Examination, they require a focused and systematic acquisition of knowledge and channelling it into goal-oriented objectives. The strategy they should adopt, should ideally consist of two steps: extensive preparation followed by internalisation of concepts. The former enables candidates to acquire all the necessary information, while the latter is meant to give a proper understanding of the subject. This book not only helps candidates to acquire knowledge systematically, but also acts as a tool for understanding of concepts deeply.</p>
<h3 class="h3s"><b class="calibre9">Methodology</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The strategy for the Main Examination necessarily involves developing a proper perspective and thorough understanding of the subject. In other words, attention should be paid to honing the analytical capability rather than mere collection of information. To enable readers to acquire a thorough understanding of <i class="calibre8">Modern World History</i>, in this book the following pertinent questions have been posed and duly answered on each and every theme/topic of the subject. In carrying out the above task, some standard textbooks have been consulted.</p>
<table class="table">
<tr class="calibre12">
<td class="tdh"><b class="calibre9">Questions</b></td>
<td class="tdh"><b class="calibre9">Answers</b></td>

<tr class="calibre12">

<tr class="calibre12">
<td class="tdb2">4. What was the outcome / impact?</td>
<td class="tdb3">Results / significance</td>

</table>
<p class="indent">In every topic/theme, there is a “General Survey” that gives a panoramic view of the topic, followed by “Detailed Analysis” which covers the topic from all possible angles in an analytical manner. I have adopted this “Self-assessment” method to make history more interesting and absorbing for both teachers and students. Besides, practice questions on almost all the topics have been provided at the end of each chapter.</p>
<h3 class="h3s"><b class="calibre9">Question-analysis</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The other part, in fact a more crucial one, for the preparation for the Main Examination pertains to the question-analysis. In the past, several types of questions have appeared in the examinations. Based on the terms and words attached to them, the questions can be classified into the following categories/types:</p>
<table class="table">
<tr class="calibre12">
<td class="tdh"><a id="calibre_link-98" class="calibre10"></a><b class="calibre9">Typology</b></td>
<td class="tdh"><b class="calibre9">Terminology</b></td>
<td class="tdh"><b class="calibre9">Requirement</b></td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre12">
<td class="tdb">I. Analytical</td>
<td class="tdb1">Discuss / comment / analyse / assess / appraise / evaluate / estimate / judge / critically examine</td>
<td class="tdb1">Merits and demerits / advantages and disadvantages / failures achievements / for and against</td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre12">
<td class="tdb3">II. Descriptive</td>
<td class="tdb3">Describe / elaborate / narrate / give an account of / enumerate / list out</td>
<td class="tdb3">Going into the details or elaboration</td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre12">
<td class="tdb">III. Explanatory</td>
<td class="tdb1">Elucidate / illustrate / explain</td>
<td class="tdb1">Explaining with the help of relevant examples</td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre12">
<td class="tdb3">IV. Causal</td>
<td class="tdb3">Account for</td>
<td class="tdb3">Giving reasons or causes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="calibre12">
<td class="tdb">V. Chronological</td>
<td class="tdb1">Trace out</td>
<td class="tdb1">Dealing in a chronological order</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="indent">Of the above five categories of questions, the analytical types are most frequently asked, accounting for almost 50 per cent and potentially high-scoring.</p>
<p class="indent">The other four categories together make up the rest and are average in scoring.</p>
<h3 class="h3s"><b class="calibre9">Answer-writing</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In writing answers to all types of questions, three factors are important. Every answer is evaluated for its relevance, clarity and precision.</p>
<p class="indent">Relevance shows subject command; clarity of thought gets expressed in lucidity of presentation; and precision demonstrates not only comprehending skills but also articulation. So, after acquiring a thorough understanding of the subject, a candidate should concentrate on the ways and means of applying it to the examination in the most effective fashion. Writing answers to as many previous and potential questions as possible and getting them evaluated is indispensable and highly rewarding in this examination.</p>
<p class="indent">In the end, I would like to express my gratitude to all my well-wishers and readers, whose unstinted support and encouragement has kept me going as a teacher and author of history for the past three decades. Finally, I would like to thank McGraw Publications in general, and Tanmoy Roychowdhury and Shukti Mukherjee in particular, for their constant support and encouragement in bringing out this book in record time.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-16">BACKGROUND TO MODERNISM: DECLINE OF FEUDALISM AND BEGINNING OF MODERNISM</h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<p class="noindent">The 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century marks a watershed in human history. Though human existence on our planet goes back to at least three million years, they have been living largely in regional isolation till the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Century. Naturally, barriers like oceans and deserts have kept them virtually segregated. It was only in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century that direct contact was established among them and they were finally brought together. Strictly speaking, one may even say that world history in its proper sense did not begin until the daring voyages of Columbus, Vasco de Gama and Magellan. Till then, there were comparatively parallel histories of separate people rather than one common history of humanity. How did this (first the segregation and then the integration of people) come about?</p>
<p class="indent">During the long period of the Palaeolithic (old stone) Age, our ancestors, the <i class="calibre8">Homo Sapiens</i>, gradually spread out from their birth place in Africa to all the continents except Antarctica. Then the Pleistocene Period (ice age) along with the Paleolithic Age ended, raising the level of the oceans and consequently splitting Africa from Europe, the Americas from Northeast Asia, Australia from South East Asia, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">From then onwards humans started living in regional isolation, though in varying degrees. <a id="calibre_link-122" class="calibre10"></a>Some were totally isolated like the Australian aborigines or the inhabitants of North and South America, while others like the sub-Saharan Africans were partially isolated. In the case of the former, oceans like the Atlantic or the Pacific became barriers to human movement, whereas in the case of the latter, this role was played by the expanding deserts like the Sahara.</p>
<p class="indent">Then what about the condition of the people of the earth’s remaining portion, namely, Europe, Asia and North Africa, which for convenience’s sake, may be described as ‘Eurasia’? Indeed, world history up to the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century was primarily the history of this Eurasia. For it was not only the place of origin of the earliest and most civilised cultures of humanity, but also the scene of almost continuous and substantial interaction of people and civilisations. While the American natives (the so-called ‘Red Indians’) and the Australian aborigines lived for thousands of years in virtual isolation, and the sub-Saharan Africans in semi-seclusion, the Eurasians in comparison were exchanging technologies, ideas, institutions and material goods.</p>
<p class="indent">However, contacts among the Eurasians were much less regular or widespread before the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century than after, when direct sea contact was established amongst all parts of the world. In the pre-modern period (i.e., the Ancient Period as well as the Middle Ages), interaction varied greatly from era to era; it was most limited in the earliest eras, and then gradually picked up momentum.</p>
<p class="indent">The four earliest civilisations that flourished in the river valleys of the Nile, Tigris-Euphrates, Indus and Hwang Ho during the pre-Christian millennia were confined mostly to their restricted localities. Though there is substantial evidence of contacts at least among some of them, they were nevertheless somewhat circumscribed oases surrounded by vast stretches of barbarism across which there was relatively little communication.</p>
<p class="indent">The situation changed considerably during the Classical Era. By the close of the first century AD when the Classical Age had reached its peak, there were four great empires, consisting of entire regions rather than single river valleys. The Romans controlled the entire Mediterranean basin, the Parthians held sway over the Middle East, the Kushans established themselves in parts of upper India and Central Asia, and the Chinese Han Dynasty ruled over the remaining territory of Asia. Consequently, large scale inter-regional contacts came to be established in almost all spheres of human activity. In fact, it was during this period that ancient religions like Buddhism and Christianity became inter-regional religions with far-reaching religious and cultural as well as political repercussions. It was also during this period that trade and commerce witnessed an unprecedented growth among the different parts of this ‘Eurasia’, while the Greek culture, known as ‘Hellenism’, spread from Eastern Mediterranean to all parts of this ‘Known World’.</p>
<p class="indent">During the Middle Ages, which witnessed the foundations of great inter-regional empires for the first time, interaction among most Eurasians became even more intense. Between 632 and 750 A.D., the Arabs established a vast Islamic empire stretching from the Pyrenees to the Indian Ocean, and from Morocco to the borders of China. Subsequently, the banner of Islam was carried further into Central Asia, India, South-East Asia and interior Africa. Furthermore, the Mongols, in the 13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, established a massive empire consisting of China, Korea, Central Asia, Russia and most of the Middle East. Nothing can be more illustrative of the new horizons than the exploits of the famous travellers, like Marco Polo (1254&ndash;1324), Ibn Battutah (1304&ndash;1378) and Rabban Bar Sauma (late 13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century). Their travels across the breadth of ‘Eurasia’ clearly demonstrated the advantages of peace and security <a id="calibre_link-123" class="calibre10"></a>established by the Arabs and the Mongols in their vast dominions.</p>
<p class="indent">However, Western Europe, during most of the pre-16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century period, was what we may now describe as an ‘under-developed area’. For even the Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and Arabs, not to speak of the Chinese, generally looked down upon the people of Western Europe as backward ‘natives’, ‘stupid’ and ‘uneducable’. Yet it was the descendants of these Western Europeans who discovered continents unknown to the Greeks and Romans and ultimately became masters of the whole world.</p>
<p class="indent">How did the Western Europeans become the leaders of the world in the modern period? In view of their previous backwardness, how did they, instead of the Chinese or the Arabs or the Indians, play a leading role in geographical discoveries and thus begin the global phase of world history? In order to answer this question, it is necessary to find out the situation in the non-European world at that time. Without going into the details, however, we can reasonably assert that the contemporary China, India and the Middle East, while being comparatively developed and wealthy, lacked the expansionism of Western Europe. In fact, it may be said that it was their wealth and development that made them selfcentered, inward-looking and, consequently, unresponsive to the changes.</p>
<p class="indent">Modern world history was marked by European expansion and eventually by the disintegration of European empires only during the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The unprecedented expansion of Europe was facilitated greatly by a variety of historical forces and factors such as the decline of decadent feudalism, beginning of dynamic capitalism, geographical discoveries, Renaissance and Reformation, emergence of national monarchs, agricultural and commercial revolutions, technological progress, population increase and the resulting growth in economic productivity and resources.</p>
<p class="indent">The newly emerged national monarchs in Europe granted charters to joint-stock companies and even backed them up militarily, if the need arose. The ex-ploits of Columbus and Vasco da Gama, for instance, would not have been possible without the necessary backing from the Spanish and Portuguese courts. The British and French courts showed no less enthusiasm in providing the necessary backing for such ventures though they did it somewhat later. As a matter of fact, the relations between monarchs and merchants were much closer in North-Western Europe (England, France, etc.) than in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), where the feudal lords, because of their close links with the crown, were still predominant. Thus, in North-Western Europe, the merchants had gradually acquired a social status and state backing that was hardly, comparable with Eurasia.</p>
<p class="indent">In China, Japan, South-East Asia, India and Middle East, on the contrary, the merchant groups were looked down upon as inferior and undesirable. In fact, none of the merchants, in any of the Oriental empires, could rise to positions of authority. Government was carried on by scholars in China, by soldiers in Japan, by the local nobility in South-East Asia, India and Middle East, but nowhere by merchants except in North-Western Europe where they were steadily gaining political as well as economic power.</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, Europe had a genuine need and strong demand for foreign products (especially Eastern spices) which were altogether lacking in other parts of Eurasia. In short, there was an impelling dynamism in Europe&mdash;a lust and an opportunity for profit. Europe at this time, as a famous scholar has said, was like a ‘giant fed through the chinks of a wall’. For during the late medieval times, a combination of developments, such as the loss of the crusaders’ outposts in <a id="calibre_link-124" class="calibre10"></a>the Levant (Eastern Mediterranean region), the break-up of the Mongol Empire, the expansion of the Ottoman Turks into central Europe, etc., isolated and fenced in the Western Europeans. These ‘prison walls’, however, could neither deter nor contain the giant whose strength and knowledge were growing for long.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, towards the end of the medieval period, Eurasia witnessed a curious and fateful development. While the Oriental people were withdrawing into themselves, the Western Europeans were experiencing an unprecedented and thorough, transformation in almost all aspects of their lives. The result was the birth of a dynamic, expansionist civilisation, viz. modern civilisation. It made Western Europe drastically different from the rest of Eurasia and, for that matter, rest of the world, characterised by the traditional agrarian-based civilisations.</p>
<p class="indent">The process of modernisation, which began in Western Europe, determined the course of modern world history. It provided the Western Europeans not only with superior economic and military power but also with superior socio-political cohesion and dynamism, and, therefore, paved the way for the European domination of the world. Modernisation, which is a continuing process rather than a sudden single event, initially comprised Renaissance and Reformation, economic expansion, emerging capitalism, state building and overseas enterprise. Later, it manifested itself in the form of the great scientific, industrial and successive political revolutions that have moulded human history to the present day.</p>
<h3 class="h3a">Decline of Feudalism and Beginning of Modernism</h3>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">General Survey</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent">Most of the kings who ruled kingdoms set up after the fall of the Roman Empire began to lose their power. With Western Europe split into several Germanic Kingdoms, there was little unified strength. The individual rulers did not have sufficient military manpower or organisation to control, millions of inhabitants in their areas. As the kings lost their ability to govern, the larger land-owning nobles gained power. Long distance travel ended as highway men, bandits and killers took over the countryside. Little law and order remained. Trade suffered because merchants, with little protection for their goods and no international standards of credit or law, could depend only on nearby markets for their sales. Many schools, libraries, and museums were closed or destroyed. Education was neglected. All this brought a new system of government called feudalism. The Age of Feudalism continued for about 1000 years (500&ndash;1500).</p>
<p class="indent">Feudalism as a system of government that offered protection in return for working a noble’s lands, replaced strong central governments. Nobles who were large landowners gained most of the power, providing armies for the king when required. The king controlled only his own estates, his domain, and gave the nobles large fiefs or grants of land. These nobles were called king’s vassals. Under the leading nobles were lesser nobles, or sub-vassals, who received fiefs from their overlords in exchange for military support. Then there were the lowest nobles, the knights who made up the armies. When faced by war, a king called on his vassals. These nobles called on their sub-vassals, who called on their knights to do the actual fighting. Feudalism’s lowest class was the serfs, who did farming and most of the other work required by their nobles.</p>
<p class="indent">The nobles owned large estates, called manors, and lived in castles, or fortresses that had thick stone walls surrounded by deep water-filled trenches, called moats. Living quarters for knights, serfs, and others were provided in the manor. The surrounding land was used for farming. Young nobles trained in tournaments, wearing armour and using swords, lances, and battle axes. The serf, while <a id="calibre_link-125" class="calibre10"></a>not a slave, was bound to the land. If the land was sold, the serf was sold with it. He worked on the noble’s farms, receiving part of the crops he raised. He also did other work on the manor receiving part of what he produced as pay. Despite his share, a serf earned only a bare living for himself and his family.</p>
<p class="indent">By the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, feudalism began to fade, particularly in Western Europe. It could not change to meet people’s new needs. As Europe approached an economy based on trade, manufacturing, and crafts, the feudal system of rigid loyalties, without the possibility of changing jobs or moving to other areas, no longer worked. Protection, once offered only by the nobles, was now also possible in cities where, in addition, a man could have more freedom.</p>
<p class="indent">As the size and number of cities increased, the political and military power of the nobles weakened. The importance of owning large lands faded as a trade economy based on money expanded. Central governments were established in cities, and one-man rule of the nobles under the feudal system declined.</p>
<p class="indent">The build-up of the nation-state had begun in Europe. Powers of kings increased as the nobles lost powers. Under feudalism, the kings had ruled in name only. With the development of nation-states, the kings’ powers greatly expanded. The age of the absolute monarch or powerful king was about to begin. As world trade expanded, a new middle class of merchants and tradesmen developed. Cities increased in size. Merchants wanted sound systems of law and order, and better opportunities. Thousands of farm workers (serfs) managed to leave their farms and seek better living conditions in the cities. In some towns, serfs who had escaped from the manors could gain their freedom after working a year and a day.</p>
<p class="indent">One reason for the downfall of nobles was the invention of gunpowder and the use of cannon. Cannons could batter down the walls of the castles which had been strongholds of the nobles. The day of the nobles’ heavily armuored knights riding on war horses and carrying battle-axes was coming to an end. Any former serf armed with a gun could easily defeat the most powerful knight.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Feudalism?</b></i></span> In the specific sense, it means a social system of rights and duties based on land tenure and personal relationships in which land is held in ‘fief’ (meaning property in land) by vassals from lords to whom they owe specific services and with whom they are bound by personal loyalty. In a broad sense, it denotes ‘feudal society’, i.e., a form of civilisation that flourishes especially in a closed agricultural economy and has certain general characteristics besides the mere presence of lords, vassals and <i class="calibre8">fiefs</i>. In such a society, those who fulfil official duties, whether civil or military, do so not for the sake of an abstract notion of the state or of public service but because of the personal and freely accepted links with their overlord, receiving remuneration in the form of <i class="calibre8">fiefs</i>, which they hold hereditarily. Since various public functions are closely associated with the <i class="calibre8">fief</i> rather than with the person who holds it, public authority becomes fragmented and decentralised. So the socio-economic and political system that developed in the medieval period first in Western Europe and later in other parts of Europe and the rest of the world (particularly the East) is called ‘Feudalism’.</p>
<p class="indent">The classical age of feudalism is usually dated from 11<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> to 13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, and located in Northern France. Other societies in different historical periods; European or non-European, are compared to this northern French society to determine the extent to which feudal institutions and tendencies developed within them.</p>
<p class="indent">The foremost characteristic of feudalism was the hierarchical division of the society based on a system of land-holding consisting of granting of fiefs in return for services and assurance of <a id="calibre_link-126" class="calibre10"></a>future services. The feudal society in Western Europe soon developed a hierarchy, in which every person was allotted a position. It was a pyramidal structure with the peasants at the bottom, followed by knights, barons, dukes and earls in the ascending order, and with the king at the top. The king bestowed fiefs or estates on a number of lesser lords, viz. dukes and earls. Those people, in their turn, distributed a part of their fiefs among a number of lesser lords, viz. barons, and in return secured their military support. Thus, dukes and earls were the king’s vassals owing allegiance directly to the king. (Similarly, the barons were the vassals of the dukes and earls). Finally, the knights who formed the lowest category of feudal lords were usually the vassals of barons for whom they performed military service. However, these knights did not have any vassals of their own. Every feudal lord, except the knight as mentioned above, was first a vassal and then an overlord with a number of vassals under him. The relationship from the top to bottom was one of allegiance. No vassal owned any land; he only held the land as of his overlord. The vassal was in every way his lord’s man and he recognised no other authority than that of his overlord. Thus, the feudal lords of different categories held the land as vassals of their overlords, and did not cultivate their lands themselves. They had peasants instead to do it for them.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00028.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">The peasants formed the lowest but the largest section of the feudal society, and they too were divided into a number of categories. The first category consisted of ‘freeholders’, who received their lands from the lords which they used and managed as their own. These peasants, instead of working for their lords, paid tax to them. The second category was formed by the ‘villeins’, who gave a part of the produce of their own lands to their lords and worked on the lords’ fields for a fixed number of days (on other days they were free to look after their own fields). The last and the most numerous category comprised ‘serfs’. Many of them had lands which they cultivated entirely for their lords. In addition, serfs had to perform any service that the lords wanted them to perform, such as bulking or repairing a house or road. These services were ‘forced labour’, because the lords got the work done without paying to the serfs. Further, the serfs suffered from many restrictions. For instance, they could not change their masters, unless the land changed hands. They also could not leave the land without the permission of the lord.</p>
<p class="indent">Soon, this whole system became hereditary. The eldest son of a lord succeeded him and demanded an oath of allegiance from his father’s vassals. The other sons of a lord were lords, the vassals’ sons were vassals and the serfs’ sons were serfs. Thus grew up a rigid society, somewhat similar to our caste system. It was difficult for a person to grow out of his class. He was bound to the class in hierarchy in which he was born.</p>
<p class="indent">Another important feature of feudalism was the Manorial or Seignorial system in which <a id="calibre_link-127" class="calibre10"></a>landlords exercised a wide variety of police, judicial, fiscal and other rights over the unfree peasantry. Each feudal lord was all powerful within his fief, which might consist of one or several manors, depending on the status of the lord. He had a wide variety of rights and duties such as maintaining the police and the armed forces, building castles, protecting the life of his tenants, deciding their cases and punishing the guilty, levying and collecting taxes from those who lived in his fief, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">Another feature of feudalism was the existence of private armies and a code of conduct in which military obligations are stressed. The king had no significant standing army with himself. Hence, in times of war, he had to summon the feudal lords who maintained their own private armies. The feudal lords, in turn, called on their vassals, and so on. Since fighting was practically the only occupation of the nobility, an elaborate code of conduct was developed for them. Kings alone could make the son of a nobleman a knight. Making a young man a knight was a ritual in which he solemnly vowed to observe his duties as a loyal vassal and to protect the weak. The knights showed special courtesy to women and often fought to uphold their honour. There are many interesting stories of knights that resemble those of Rajput heroes in Indian history.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How and why did it Decline?</b></i></span> The decline of feudalism was due to the socio economic and political transformations of the 12<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries on one hand, and the defective features inherent in the system itself on the other. We will first examine the transformations and their effects on feudalism, and then proceed to the defective features of feudalism.</p>
<p class="indent">The economic transformations were the result of the 12<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century ‘Urban Revolution’. But before that, the feudal economy was highly localised and essentially self-sufficient. The production was for local use, and the needs of the people for non-agricultural goods such as cloth and agricultural implements were also met locally. In this kind of economy, there was no need of towns. However, gradually from the 11<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 12<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, trade and towns began to become important. There was an increase in the demand for luxury goods by the lords. The contacts with the East, which the ‘holy wars’ (crusades) had facilitated, created demand for luxury goods of the East. With the extension of cultivation and improvements in agricultural methods, many peasants were in a position to exchange a part of their agricultural products for non-agricultural goods. These developments encouraged the growth of crafts and trade, and led to the emergence of towns.</p>
<p class="indent">The revival of money economy, renewal of city life and its more complex division of labour, the rise of the new social-stratum of burgesses&mdash;all proclaimed new needs and possibilities. They enabled the state to perform and enlarge its functions without constant recourse to feudal service. The new market situation enabled the peasants to accumulate money from the sale of surplus production, and initiate the commutation of manorial services into money payments. The final result was the disruption of the manorial economy and a profound change in the standing of the nobility.</p>
<p class="indent">The process of dissolution on the manorial level brought about a complete transformation in patterns of social cohesion and state organisation. Different strata of society became crystallised in the pattern of ‘estates’. The estate grouped people of the same social class, who had similar economic standing, and enjoyed the same privileged position in the state in relation to the crown and other estates. Unlike the former feudal links of cohesion, which were vertical, the new links binding man to man were horizontal. Men joining others or their own class sought assurance and confirmation of their privileged position, more than security and protection. A man’s standing was no longer described in terms of his belonging to a given <a id="calibre_link-128" class="calibre10"></a>‘estate’. The hierarchic pattern continued to exist, but as a strata of society instead of a hierarchy of individuals. Moreover, there were no formal links of dependence between the different estates. In other words all were in direct relation to the crown, and each claimed a share in political power, whether national or local.</p>
<p class="indent">Insecurity gradually decreased in the distant states of the central Middle Ages, and the rural population did not depend for its survival or defence on the local magnate. The political power they wielded could be, and was, more efficiently used by state officials. Inherited political power consequently lost its practical and moral justification. Soon after, powerful monarchies began to rise in some of the West European countries such as France, Spain, England, etc., and this hastened the decline of feudalism. These monarchies devised various methods to crush the weakened position of the feudal lords, and in this they got the full support of the newly risen middle class, who were eager to usher in a new system.</p>
<p class="indent">The hierarchical division of the feudal society led to the gradual development of a rigid class system. Man was divided from man, and class from class. This gulf (both economic and social) between the nobles and the common people (serfs) proved harmful to the very existence of feudalism. The nobles lived in palatial buildings and led a luxurious life at the cost of the common people. The serfs, on the other hand, suffered from many social and economic disabilities, and led a poor and wretched life, mainly because they could not reap the fruits of their own labour. They were completely at the mercy of their cruel and immoral master. Naturally, a system with this kind of blatant injustice and inequality could not last very long, particularly when the circumstances that led to its establishment were no longer there.</p>
<p class="indent">The feudal polity was equally defective as it fostered local loyalties at the cost of national unity, and had a weak central government and defective military organisation. The feudal lord held and ruled their fiefs as they wished, cared more for their own interests and ignored the interests of the nation as a whole. The king was entirely dependent on these feudal lords for military as well as financial help. Sometimes the powerful lords asserted their independence, and the king was in no position to control them. Since the vassals owed allegiance directly to their overlords and not to the king, it became even more difficult for the king to contain the recalcitrant nobles.</p>
<p class="indent">Feudal economy was also defective because it led to economic stagnation. The wealth produced by the peasants and the artisans was wastefully consumed by the feudal lords in luxurious living and wars. Enterprises and individual initiative were all but unknown. Finally, innovations were not encouraged.</p>
<p class="indent">Feudalism also proved harmful for the development of arts, literature and crafts. Lords and their vassals attached great importance to and encouraged fighting and warlike activities. Much attention could not be paid to literary activities and cultural development.</p>
<p class="indent">Although feudalism by the end of the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century was no longer a political and social force, it had left its mark on the European society. It exercised its greatest influence in the elaboration of the modern forms of constitutional government. Ideas about consent to taxes, resistance to and defiance of the lord, and the balance between rights and duties among lords and vassals played a great role in colouring the outlook of early representative institutions.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-17">TWIN FORCES OF MODERNISM: RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION</h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a">Renaissance in Europe</h3>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">General Survey</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent">The Renaissance, which is a French word meaning <i class="calibre8">rebirth</i> or <i class="calibre8">revival</i>, led Europe out of <a id="calibre_link-129" class="calibre10"></a>the Middle Ages and into the modern times. It was a period between the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and early 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries. The rebirth occurred in the fields of art, literature and science. Among the people of the Middle Ages, life after death had been of greater concern than their daily hardships. The Renaissance brought many changes in a man’s way of thinking and in his opportunities to enjoy his life. Towns grew, trade expanded and new areas of the world were discovered. Men realised that they had control over their own lives. They became confident, ready to adopt changes, and more resentful of unjust rulers.</p>
<p class="indent">The term ‘Renaissance’ was coined by 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century intellectuals who believed that their age represented the rebirth of classical culture following an intervening ‘age of darkness’ of the medieval period. This interpretation was accepted through the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, but historians today no longer consider it to have been a case of medieval pitch darkness as against Renaissance’s dazzling light. The fact is that the interest in the classics was by no means completely absent during the Middle Ages, and conversely, certain characteristics associated with Medieval Ages were very much in evidence during the Renaissance. So modern historians, while not discarding the familiar term Renaissance, now define it as connoting not a sharp break or turning pint, but rather an age of transition from medieval to modern civilisation&mdash;roughly from 1350 to 1600.</p>
<p class="indent">The Renaissance got underway first in Italy, and hence reflected the conditions and values of contemporary Italian society. This was a bustling urban society based on flourishing industries and on the profitable commerce between Western Europe and the wealthy Byzantine and Islamic Empires. The Italians were the middlemen in this commerce and prospered accordingly. The Italian cities were dominated by the great merchant families who controlled politics as well as trade and crafts. These families were the patrons of Renaissance artists and writers. Their needs, interests, and tastes coloured the Renaissance cultural revival even though the patrons also included Popes such as Nicholas V, Pius II, Julius II, and Leo X.</p>
<p class="indent">At the centre of Renaissance art and literature was the new Renaissance person who was the moulder of his own destiny rather than a plaything of supernatural forces. People did not have to be preoccupied with supernatural forces, rather the purpose of life was to develop one’s innate potential. ‘Men can do all things if they will’, wrote Leon Battista Alberti (1404&ndash;1472), and his own attainments abundantly validated this maxim.</p>
<p class="indent">The secularism and individualism of Renaissance was reflected in its scholarship and education. The so-called father of Renaissance literature, Francesco Petrarch (1304&ndash;1374), stressed the value of the classics as a means for self-improvement and guide to social action. Likewise, the new board schools of Renaissance trained not priests but the sons of merchants. The curriculum emphasised classical studies and physical exercise, and was designed to educate students to live well and happy and to function as responsible citizens.</p>
<p class="indent">The Renaissance spirit was most strikingly expressed in its art. Since the Church was no longer the sole patron, artists were encouraged to turn to subjects other than the traditional Biblical themes. Giotto (1276&ndash;1337) and the versatile genius, Leonardo da Vinci (1452&ndash;1519), are the best examples.</p>
<p class="indent">About 1550, after two centuries of sparkling achievement, Italian Renaissance began to wane. One reason for the decline was the French invasion in 1494 which precipitated decades of war and left the Italian peninsula devastated. Another reason was the economic blow suffered when Vasco da Gama sailed into Calicut. This ended the profitable monopoly that the Italians enjoyed as the middlemen in <a id="calibre_link-130" class="calibre10"></a>the trade between Western and Eastern Europe. More serious than this commercial decline was the industrial decline. For centuries, Italy had exported manufactured goods, especially textiles, to Northern Europe and the near East, and had also derived substantial revenues from banking and shipping services. But by the late 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Century, the British, French, and Dutch had surpassed the Italians who were hampered by restricting guild regulations, high taxes and labour costs, and failure to adapt goods to changing tastes. The gap between Italy and the Northern European countries was further widened by the growing importance of colonial trade from which the Italian cities lacking overseas possessions were excluded. Italy, which had been the developed part of Europe during the Middle Ages, now became the underdeveloped. It was Italy that henceforth exported raw materials (oil, wine, grain, wool, and raw silk) to Northern Europe in return for manufactured goods.</p>
<p class="indent">The Renaissance, however, was not an exclusively Italian phenomenon. Its innovations spread to Northern Europe in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The instruments of diffusion were Italian diplomats and generals employed by northern monarchs, and the printing press which accelerated the circulation of books and ideas. In the process of transmission northward, the Renaissance changed somewhat in character. Whereas in Italy it had manifested itself primarily in art and literature, in the North, it found expression more in religion and morals. However, this was, by no means exclusively so, as evident in the works of German painters such as Albrecht Durer (1471&ndash;1528), and Hans Holbein (1497&ndash;1543).</p>
<p class="indent">Printing was particularly influential in Northern Europe because literacy was more widespread there than in the southern and eastern regions of Europe. The flood of printed matter certainly fomented popular agitation concerning political and religious issues, thereby contributing substantially to the Reformation and the ensuing religious and dynastic wars. Printing also stimulated the development of national schools of literature during this early modern period.</p>
<p class="indent">What is the significance of the Renaissance in the perspective of world history? It is apparent that new emphasis on man and on what he could accomplish obviously was more conducive to overseas expansion than the preceding medieval outlook. The fact is that Renaissance Europe was not science-oriented. The leading figures were inclined towards aesthetic and philosophical than objective and sceptical. They retained, in various degrees, certain medieval patterns of thought. They persisted in admiring and believing the incredible and the fantastic. They continued to seek the philosopher’s stone that would convert other metals into gold. They still believed in astrology and mistook it with astronomy.</p>
<p class="indent">The Iberian pioneers of overseas expansion definitely were not ‘Renaissance men’. Prince Henry, the Navigator, for example, was described by his contemporaries as a rigid, pious, and chivalrous ascetic rather than as a humanist. Although a generous patron of sailors and cartographers, he was not interested in learning and the arts. Thus, the stimulation of rapidly widening ‘new intellectual horizons’ explains less about the origins of European expansion before 1500 than it does about the impetus and irresistible power that knowledge explosion provided after 1600. Indeed, European expansion was vastly important in its own right. The fact remains that there was an intellectual ferment in Western Europe and that it had no counterpart in the rest of Eurasia. This is a fundamental difference of enormous significance.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Renaissance?</b></i></span> ‘Renaissance’ is a collective term used to include all the intellectual changes that were in evidence at the close of the Middle Ages and the beginning of modern times. It denotes an intellectual, <a id="calibre_link-131" class="calibre10"></a>literary, artistic and scientific movement which widened the mental horizons of man. The intellectual revival was manifested in an interest in the past and a desire for understanding the present. Its greatest attribute, perhaps, was the development of inquisitiveness which is necessary for intellectual progress. Interest in which earlier civilisations had contributed was great, and the Classics were revived.</p>
<p class="indent">Renaissance included much that was not found in art and literature. In economic life, for instance, the simple agricultural ways of the manor were altered by commerce and industry. In social relationship, the manor, the nobleman’s castle, and the bishop’s palace gave way to the crowded and busy towns. In the political sphere, there was a new consciousness manifested in the decline of the feudal lords and the papacy, and in the rise of powerful monarchies and nation states. In the scientific field, astronomy, physiology and medicine were investigated with sound scientific procedure, instead of the old method of theological scholasticism.</p>
<p class="indent">Man was in the process of making a fundamental change in his attitude towards himself and the world in which he lived. This point of view is commonly called ‘Humanism’. The Humanists were primarily interested in classical literature, but the effect of this interest was more than a revival of the study of Greek and Latin languages. It focused on things of this world, and hence the exaltation of human nature. The natural, the human and the sensual were given precedence over the ascetical, the supernatural, and the theological.</p>
<p class="indent">Renaissance, thus, was a great movement of roughly 250 years in European history that began in Italy in the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and spread to Northern Europe by 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and that revived man’s power of original thinking on scientific lines and encouraged him to express himself freely and fearlessly in all matters concerning life. In short, intellectualism, humanism and the spirit of enquiry are the chief features of Renaissance. It would, in fact, be quite proper to describe it as ‘the Age of Expansion&mdash;intellectual, cultural, geographical and commercial’.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Take Place?</b></i></span> Philosophers and thinkers like Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, St. Francis of Assisi, Cimabue and Dante, who were the moving spirits of the new era, lived in the 13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. In the medieval period, the church dominated the human mind and activities. It was difficult to question its authority. But these philosophers revolutionised thought and laid great stress on the spirit of enquiry, reasoning, independent thinking and scientific investigation. Thomas Aquinas, for instance, declared that the prime author and mover of the universe was intelligence. Roger Bacon made a bold appeal for the free use of powers of mind. Thus, the spirit of inquiry and free thinking gave great impetus to the Renaissance movement.</p>
<p class="indent">The invention of the printing press was a very important factor for the spread of Renaissance. Before the invention of the printing press, it was very difficult to spread knowledge because books were written by hand and were also costly. This made knowledge a privilege of the people. Things changed drastically with the invention of the printing press. The first printing press was set up in 1465 in Germany by Gutenberg. Later on, Caxton introduced it in England in 1476. Printing presses were also set up in Italy and Hungary.</p>
<p class="indent">All these helped in publishing books in large numbers. Besides, printing was more accurate than copying by hand, and as a consequence printed books became more dependable. Books now reached the common man, and they went a long way in spreading knowledge. Increase in education and knowledge also gave a great impetus to the literary activity of the Renaissance and widened the mental horizons of people.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides, there were other scientific developments that paved the way for the <a id="calibre_link-132" class="calibre10"></a>Renaissance. Galileo, for example, invented telescope, and Copernicus proved that the Earth moves around the Sun. Leonardo placed his new scientific ideas and discoveries fearlessly. Bacon contemplated the use of horseless carriages and flying machines. All these inventions broadened the mental outlook of the people and put an end to the old beliefs and traditions.</p>
<p class="indent">The European navigators, especially those under the patronage of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns, played an important role in the geographical discoveries. After the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453 AD, the Europeans felt the need of discovering new sea routes to the East. They succeeded in discovering not only new searoutes to the East but also many new lands and continents. These geographical discoveries and explorations brought the people of Western Europe into close contact with the people of Asia and their cultures. In the process, many misnomers and misconceptions about the world, the shape of the Earth, the seas and oceans were removed, and many new things were learnt.</p>
<p class="indent">The commercial revolution that resulted due to the geographical discoveries, led to the establishment of many flourishing towns and cities in Europe, and also to the rise of middle classes which began to play an important role in the history of Europe. The new towns and cities grew into wealthy Renaissance cities and soon became centres of Renaissance art and learning. The middle classes not only became wealthy but also gained in social status. They opened new schools for their children which were free from the dominance of the church. The new learning and education liberalised their ideas and broadened their outlook.</p>
<p class="indent">Wealthy and influential people, like kings, Popes, nobles, merchants, etc., became patrons of the new movement. King Francis I of France invited Italian classical scholars to his country to train Frenchmen in the new learning. Henry VIII of England, Charles V of Spain, Sigismund I of Poland and Christian II of Denmark encouraged scholars to come to their courts. Pope Nicholas V and Leo X were great lovers of the classical art, literature and music. They became the patrons of this movement, and encouraged the revival of Graeco-Roman classics. Some of the wealthy families began to buy antiques, and patronised artists to decorate their houses. The Medici family in Florence (Italy), for instance, patronised Renaissance artists, painters, sculptors and learned men such as Michael Angelo, Leonardo, etc.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How and where did Renaissance Take Place?</b></i></span> In the Middle Ages, literature was dominated by religion and was written in Latin. But the Renaissance writers wrote about man and everything connected with man. Further, instead of writing in Latin, they began to write in languages of the people (vernaculars). As a result, all over Europe, vernacular prose was gradually raised to a position of literary dignity. Thus, literature ‘during Renaissance’ evolved from a type dictated by churchmen and scholastics to one embodying secularism and individualism. Moreover, the revived interest in the form and composition of classical Greek and Latin languages was carried over into the study of the new languages (Italian, German, French, Spanish, Dutch, etc.) on a scientific basis.</p>
<p class="indent">While Italy was the home of many famous literary figures of the Renaissance, a literature typical of that period can be found in France, England, Germany, Holland, Spain and Portugal. Machiavelli was the great political writer of Italy, and his work <i class="calibre8">The Prince</i>, written in Italian, served as a guide for the rulers. Dante’s <i class="calibre8">Divine Comedy</i> is an epic poem, and reveals human love, love for the country and a desire for a free and united Italian nation, though its main theme is the state of soul after death. The works of Petrarch, who has been called the ‘Father of Humanism’, made Italy supreme in Renaissance literature. They dealt <a id="calibre_link-133" class="calibre10"></a>with the economic, social and political aspects of man’s life.</p>
<p class="indent">English literature reached the height of its glory in the Renaissance era. Chaucer was the father of English poetry. Thomas More wrote <i class="calibre8">Utopia</i> in Latin, and it contained criticism of the society and government of the day. Shakespeare, Ben Johnson and Marlowe were the renowned dramatists. The works of Shakespeare particularly have never been excelled in any language. Francois Rabelais and Michel <i class="calibre8">de</i> Montaigne were the prominent literary personalities in France. The works of Montaigne especially reflect an intense interest in himself and in things connected with the life of man. In Germany, Martin Luther’s translation of the Bible into German helped to develop that language for general use. The greatest Renaissance scholar of Holland was Erasmus, the author of <i class="calibre8">The Praise of Folly</i>, in which he condemned the evils of the church and the atrocities of the clergymen. In Spain, the important literary figures were Cervantes (author of <i class="calibre8">Don Quixote</i>) and Lope <i class="calibre8">de</i> Vega (dramatist). The Portuguese writer, Camoens, described the wonderful voyages of Vasco <i class="calibre8">de</i> Gama in his epic, <i class="calibre8">Lusiads</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, although Renaissance literature was characterised by a revived interest in classical literature, literary activity of the period was not confined to the classical style. There was a tendency to break away from Latin and Greek and to seek expression in the vernacular languages. This was a significant step, not only in bringing about the development of national literature but also in aiding the development of national political institutions.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout the Middle Ages and well into Renaissance, art was dominated largely by christian church. Christian art in the early period was tender and humane. However, organised theology had a devastating effect on art, which became a vehicle of dogma. There was a tendency on the part of churchmen to widen the breach between art and life, to recoil in horror from realism, the human body, and the whole external world. Under such restrictions, art tended to become hard, conventional, and more restrained than what had been typical of the Middle Ages. There was an adoption of classical art forms for Christian uses.</p>
<p class="indent">Painting was less influenced by classical works than architecture and sculpture. Paintings of ancient Greece and Rome were scarce, and the artists of the Renaissance had an opportunity to be original. The spirit of humanism prevailed in painting, but the subject matter was distinctly christian. Painting, known as frescoes, were painted on plaster walls. Oil painting was also invented.</p>
<p class="indent">Renaissance painting bloomed profusely in Italy. Here it received its impetus and became representative of the spirit of the Renaissance. A number of painters held a prominent place in the pre-Renaissance period (e.g., Cimabue, Giotto, etc.), but they were overshadowed by the brilliance of Michael Angelo (1475&ndash;1564), Raphaell (1483&ndash;1520) and Leonardo da Vinci (1442&ndash;1514) who are considered as the most dominant figures among the Renaissance painters. Besides these Italian painters, Albrecht Durer and Holbein of Germany, Velasquez, Murillo and El Graeco of Spain, and Rubbens and Van of Holland were the other renowned painters of the Renaissance era.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of the observations made above on the evolution of painting apply to sculpture as well, except that in technique, the sculptor could rely more closely on classical traditions than could the painter, because sculpture was more developed in classical time and the work was in a state of better preservation. Secondly, Renaissance sculptors studied the human body thoroughly and knew how the muscles and joints worked so they could make their figures more life-like. A famous sculptor, named Ghiberti, made the doors for the Baptistery at Florence.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-134" class="calibre10"></a>The huge statues of David, Moses and the Pieta chiselled out by Michelangelo are really praiseworthy. Michelangelo was, in fact, more revolutionary as a sculptor than as a painter. All these Italian sculptors were invited to England, France and Spain, and they spread Renaissance over the whole of the Western Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">In renaissance architecture, there was a trend toward classicism. The Gothic style (medieval style) which was essentially Christian in origin, was discarded for the arch, the dome, and the columns characterising the Greek and Roman models. Secondly, while the classical element was basic in Renaissance architecture, the latter had an emphasis upon design and ornamentation. In the latter period, this tendency became so predominant that it degenerated into what is called the baroque; an extremely ornate style.</p>
<p class="indent">Alberti, Manetti, Michelangelo, were some of the famous Renaissance architects. Great churches like St. Peter’s at Rome, St. Paul’s at London, St. Mark’s at Venice are examples of this new type. The Pitti palace in Florence and the Farness palace in Rome furnish noteworthy instances of Renaissance secular architecture. The existence of these secular buildings emphasises the tendency noted in painting and sculpture, viz. a shifting from the medieval absorbing interest in future life to a universal emphasis on individual and his earthly existence.</p>
<p class="indent">Renaissance music, more than any other arts time, was free from classical influence. Though music was still dominated by religion, several fundamental changes were made in music in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Century. Particular attention was given to harmony, rhythm and symmetry. Musical instruments were also improved, and violin and piano became very popular. Palestrina was the leading musician of the Roman school and his ‘Book of Masses’ (1544 A.D.) has been used ever since. Philip Neri founded the order of Oratorians in Rome, and this served as a forerunner for the modern opera. Martin Luther, seeing the advantage of the popularised use of music in his church, wanted people to take an active part in congregation singing. He also published the first popular religious hymnbook in history in 1524.</p>
<p class="indent">Science made some progress in the Middle Ages, but the spirit of modern science was born with the Renaissance. Science in the Middle Ages struggled against restrictions, and there were many fetters to be destroyed before it could continue unhampered. Superstitions were common and, to the masses, were much more acceptable than scientific explanations. The Renaissance, however, brought about an interest in all things pertaining to men, and the thirst for new achievements led to a critical observation of natural phenomena. The spirit of learning was manifested in science as much as in any other field of endeavour, if not more.</p>
<p class="indent">Scientists of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Century made the first effective protest against the medieval scientific method of accepting theories before investigation had verified them. Francis Bacon (1561&ndash;1626), for example, pointed out that classical scientific conclusions did not represent mature knowledge, and implored men to explore the realms of nature. Descartes (1506&ndash;1650) brought out convincingly the necessity of questioning everything. He doubted what the Greeks were supposed to have discovered, and he questioned the conclusions that the scholastics had made on the basis of Greek science. Thus, Descartes contributed the ideas of doubt, and doubt was the forerunner of a new age in science.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Significance?</b></i></span> People in the Middle ages had blind faith in the church, its dogmas and rituals. They followed blindly the preachings of the priests as they were very keen to improve their future life, i.e., life after death. They accepted various theories without bothering to verify or investigate them. But Renaissance marked the end of the age of blind faith and the advent of the age of reason and scientific outlook in Europe. It encouraged original thinking, the spirit of enquiry and scientific investigation, and in the process, it freed man from the mantle of slavery of the church. Moreover, people now began to attach great importance to worldly life, and all their efforts were now directed to make it happier and prosperous. Renaissance also created an interest in man, his interests, his nature and his life in this world. This developed Humanism and encouraged the study of humanities such as history and literature.</p>

<p class="indent">Renaissance gave great impetus to the growth of various arts, such as painting, sculpting, architecture and music. It also encouraged the study of different sciences and led to various scientific inventions and discoveries. With regard to literature and education, the invention of printing press helped in bringing out cheap and more reliable books in large numbers. Schools, colleges and universities were opened at various places which helped in spreading education and knowledge. Renaissance also led to the growth of vernacular languages and vernacular literature of high standard. It thus enriched European civilisation and culture.</p>
<p class="indent">Renaissance did not usher in an era of democracy but it promoted the spirit of nationalism and paved the way for the rise of nation-states, under powerful monarchies in England, France, Spain, Holland, Portugal, etc. These monarchies ensured peace, security, political stability and economic prosperity in these countries.</p>
<p class="indent">The geographical discoveries and contact with the East and the New World promoted <a id="calibre_link-136" class="calibre10"></a>trade and industry of Europe. The national income of the European countries increased tremendously, and there was an increase in the standards of living of the Europeans. All these developments inevitably led to the rise of a powerful middle class which in alliance with the absolute monarchies put an end to the power of the feudal lords.</p>
<p class="indent">Church in the Middle Ages was supreme in religious matters and had great influence in all other spheres of life. But with the growth of the spirit of inquiry and development of critical attitude, people began to question the authority and supremacy of the Church. They now raised a strong voice against the evils that had penetrated the Church. This led to the Reformation movement and the decline of the power of the church in Europe.</p>
<h3 class="h3a">Reformation in Europe</h3>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">General Survey</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent">As the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century began, a revolt against the Roman Catholic Church gained strength in Western Europe. At that time, all Christians in Western Europe were members of the Catholic Church. Criticism of the Church had been growing among some religious and political leaders. Out of criticism and opposition, came Reformation, or search for changes and improvements. The Reformation occurred in two parts&mdash;Protestant Reformation and Catholic counter reformation.</p>
<p class="indent">Several reasons were given by those who broke away from the Catholic Church during the Reformation. Some rulers did not like Catholic Church’s claim of authority over them. Religious arguments sometimes led to wars. Some claimed that the Pope had too much power over the political affairs of nations far from Rome. The Church’s wealth was resented. Rulers objected to the Church not paying taxes on its vast land holdings. Some people objected to having their church donations sent to Rome, rather than being used in their own countries.</p>
<p class="noindent">Groups of businessmen disliked the Church rule that forbade them from charging interest on loans.</p>
<p class="indent">Influence of the Renaissance also contributed to the build-up that led to the Reformation. In the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century an English theologian, John Wycliffe, charged that the Church’s formal services were meaningless&mdash;that religion was an individual matter between man and God. Wycliffe’s followers, the Lollards were badly treated. John Huss, a Bohemian religious leader, was burned at the stake in 1415 because of his criticisms of the Church. When his followers, the Hussites, rebelled, they were put down by the armies of the holy Roman Emperor. In Florence, Italy, Friar Savonarola denounced the excesses of the Church. For a while, he had a large following but when he was excommunicated, he lost his support, and the Church was again victorious in asserting its supremacy over the reformers. Included in the charges against the Church was nepotism, the appointment of relatives to Church offices, regardless of ability. Another was the Church’s pardoning of sins for a certain payment, called ‘indulgences’. The selling of appointments to Church offices for money, called ‘simony’, was another reason for the revolt.</p>
<p class="indent">Martin Luther, a German priest, wanted changes in the Catholic Church. He listed criticisms against the Catholic Church and his differing beliefs about religious authority. Luther’s views were widely reprinted, and the Reformation or the Protestant movement had begun. Luther argued that man’s salvation (saving of his soul) rested between himself and God and that the Bible, not the Pope, was the final authority. He believed that faith brought salvation. Luther won many followers in Germany and his beliefs came to be known as Lutheranism. As Luther’s attacks on the Church continued, the Pope excommunicated him. But he was supported by many German rulers who welcomed the revolt against the Pope.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-137" class="calibre10"></a>When the Luther Church was established in Northern Germany, civil wars broke out between German princes. Some supported Luther, others the Pope. A treaty signed at Augsburg in 1555 allowed each German ruler to choose for himself and his people whether to follow Catholicism or Lutheranism. In general, German states got divided into Lutheran North and Catholic South. Soon Martin Luther’s ideas spread into other European countries. Rulers in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden made Lutheranism the official state religion.</p>
<p class="indent">In Switzerland, Ulrich Zwingli, a religious reformer, won followers to his form of Protestantism. Zwingli was killed in a short Catholic Protestant war that led to a peace agreement allowing each Swiss district, or canton, to choose its own style of Christianity. Geneva, an independent city in Switzerland, asked John Calvin, a French Protestant scholar, to organise a Protestant Church there. Though a follower of Lutheranism, he held some views that differed from Lutheran teaching. Calvin believed in predestination, or that man’s fate had been determined in advance. Calvin also taught that man should work hard, be serious, and have high morals because this pleased God. Calvinism spread as people from other countries went to Geneva to hear Calvin’s sermons. In time, Calvinism in Switzerland became the Swiss reformed Church. In Scotland, John Knox established Calvinism as the Presbyterian Church. In France, a small group, called Huguenots, were Calvinists. In England, Calvinists were known as the Puritans.</p>
<p class="indent">England broke with the Roman Catholic Church over an argument between King Henry VIII and Pope Clement VII. The Pope refused to grant Henry VIII at first, a loyal Catholic, a divorce from his Spanish wife, Catherine of Aragon. Catherine had not given Henry any sons, and the king wanted to marry an English girl. He also wanted the vast Catholic Church lands in England. Catherine’s nephew, Charles V of Spain, the most powerful Catholic ruler of Europe, opposed the divorce. Henry appointed a new archbishop who dissolved Henry’s marriage to Catherine. Henry then married Anne Boleyn and caused the Parliament to pass an Act of Supremacy. This established the independent Church of England and made him, and not the Pope, the religious leader of that church. Under Henry VIII’s successors, Protestant reforms were introduced. The Anglican Church, a form of Protestantism, became the official state religion of England.</p>
<p class="indent">A program of reforms known as the Catholic Reformation, or Counter Reformation was undertaken by the Catholic Church to offset the Protestant Reformation. The church had held councils whenever serious religious problems arose. In 1542, Pope Paul III called the Council of Trent. Meeting from 1545 to 1563, it upheld all Catholic religious beliefs and services but changed some procedures.</p>
<p class="indent">Activities of the ‘Inquisition’ were widened and strengthened. The Holy Inquisition, a system of Church investigation, tried people on charges of heresy. Several new religious orders were established. The Capuchins, a branch of the Franciscans, cared for the poor and the sick. An order of nuns, the Ursulines, educated girls. The Society of Jesus, called Jesuits, was founded in 1534 by a Spaniard, Ignatius Loyola, and conducted worldwide missionary work.</p>
<p class="indent">By the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the Catholic Counter-Reformation had persuaded many people to return to the Catholic Church. The spread of Protestantism was slowed in France, Hungary, and Poland. Catholicism was maintained in Austria, Ireland, Bavaria, and the Southern Netherlands (present Belgium). New people were converted to the Catholic faith in North America, India, China and Japan.</p>
<p class="indent">The legacy of the Reformation is ambiguous. It sowed the seeds of doctrinal dissension and intolerance which culminated in a succession of bloody religious wars. The resulting <a id="calibre_link-138" class="calibre10"></a>fragmentation of Western Christendom compelled the contending sects to accept the fact that the hegemony of any universal Church was not feasible. Hence the gradual acceptance and implementation of religious toleration &ndash; a process so slow and contested that it is not yet fully complete. The Reformation was equally ambiguous concerning the status of the individual. Luther championed individual interpretation of the Scriptures, but when this led to the radicalism of the Anabaptists and to peasant revolts, he called on the civil authorities to destroy them. Yet the emphasis on the reading of the Bible did lead to greater literacy which opened doors to books and ideas other than religious.</p>
<p class="indent">So far as the immediate legacy of the Reformation was concerned, it shattered the universal medieval Church into a large number of local territorial churches &ndash; national, princely, provincial, and some confined to a single city. The common feature of all these local Churches was their control by secular rulers. Regardless of whether the Church remained Catholic in doctrine or adhered to one of the Protestant faiths, it was the secular authority that controlled ecclesiastical appointments and Church finances. The immediate and decisive legacy of the Reformation was the transfer from the Church to the state. In this sense, the Reformation represents a state in the evolution of the modern nation-state.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Meaning?</b></i></span> In the Middle Ages, the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, was accepted as final in religion and as a necessity in an orderly civilised society. It was crowned with the sanctity of having been founded by Jesus Christ and was considered a perfect order, whose officials were above any coercion. They had control of the means of a salvation: no one outside the Church could possibly be saved. The masses accepted these conditions as a matter of course. However, in course of time many abuses crept into the Church, and it headed towards its decline. As a result, the apparent security of the Church and the predominance of its power were challenged quite unexpectedly by a group of reformers in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. So ‘Reformation’ was a protest against certain practices of the Roman Catholic Church and an attempt to remove the evils. As it turned out, the reformers and the protesters separated themselves from the Roman Catholic Church, and started new Protestant Churches. Thus, the Christians in Europe came to be divided into two major groups &ndash; Protestants (those who rose against the papal authority and monopoly of the Roman Catholic Church) and Catholics (those who remained loyal to the Roman Catholic Church).</p>
<p class="indent">Reformation was, therefore, the swan-song of the medieval order. For, it ended the monopolistic power of the Universal Church, which was one of the greatest of all medieval institutions. This great religious upheaval not only was the evidence of a great religious change, but also proclaimed the dawn of a new era in Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">While both the Renaissance and the Reformation aided in the breakdown of the old order, and each contributed to the establishment of the new, they operated individually and in some cases, were opposed to each other. Some Protestant Humanists or Reformists utilised classical studies in religious controversies, but Humanism (an important part of the Renaissance) stimulated pagan learning, which austere Protestants condemned. Paganism rebelled against the other-worldliness of scholastic Christianity, while leading Protestants revived supernaturalism and even witchcraft. Moreover, many of the early Humanists were loyal Roman Catholics, critical of ecclesiastical excesses but interested primarily in merely reforming the established Church. Some Protestants were, however, bitter critics of the cult of humanity and of beauty expressed in the Renaissance.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-139" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Begin?</b></i></span> The Roman Catholic Church, typical of the institutions of the Middle Ages, was monopolistic, absolute and uncompromising. As long as it was well organised and the clergy was dutiful, the Church was able to maintain its hold on the minds of the people and to command respect from them. But with the accumulation of wealth and worldly power by the Church, the clergy were tempted to neglect their spiritual duties and became engrossed in worldly pursuits. As the Popes and the clergymen became ambitious and began to lead a luxurious life, many abuses and evil practices grew in the Church. Clerical offices were no longer filled by the worthy men but were sold for money, which was known as ‘Simony’.</p>
<p class="indent">According to another obnoxious practice, viz. ‘Plurality’, a clergyman could hold more than one post. These clergymen behaved like feudal lords and exploited the people. Besides, a clergyman of every state was required to pay his first year’s income to the Pope as ‘Annates’ or ‘first Fruit’. Even the Popes sold various kinds of pardoncertificates, such as the ‘Indulgences’, ‘Absolutions’ and ‘Dispensations’ ostensibly to save the people from sins, crimes and fire of hell. Again, the clergy did not keep the vows of celibacy, poverty and service of mankind. The Church had, in fact, deteriorated to a kind of commercial organisation.</p>
<p class="indent">Abuses in the Church might not have been a fundamental cause for its decline, but they did provide weapons for opponents to wield. Many reformers of the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries such as Wycliffe, Huss and Savonarola attacked the priesthood and challenged the church on these grounds. All of them were convicted as heretics and severely punished, but criticism of the Church did not stop. Erasmus (1466&ndash;1538), a Renaissance scholar from Holland, criticised the clergy and the blind faith of the people. He pleaded for a return to the simple teachings of Jesus Christ and wanted to reform the Church by appeal to reason.</p>
<p class="indent">The Renaissance bred the spirit of enquiry, developed critical attitude of mind, and widened the mental outlook of men. It encouraged original and independent thinking on scientific lines. People now began to question the authority of the Pope and criticise the corrupt practices, rituals and the immoral life of the clergy. Many pious Christians began to study the Bible themselves, as it was now translated into their own languages. They now began to question the authority of the Pope as the only means of salvation. Moreover, the learned people began to raise a strong voice against the abuses that had invaded the Church.</p>
<p class="indent">The Pope thought himself to be the representative of God on Earth. Regarding the kings to be his subjects, he claimed authority to throne or dethrone them. Hence, Popes frequently interfered in the internal affairs of different states. In doing so, the Church assumed a role that was quite alien to religion itself. The interference of the Popes in the political affairs of different states was strongly opposed by the kings, and they became anti-Pope. The kings strongly supported the Reformation in order to weaken the Church and to strengthen their own position.</p>
<p class="indent">The position of the kings to the Roman Catholic Church and their support to the Reformation increased with the emergence of nation-states in Europe. Rulers of many European nation-states, such as France, England, Spain, Holland, etc., and many of their subjects now began to regard the Pope as an outsider. They objected to the concept of Universal Church, and wanted a national Church free from the control of a foreign Pope. The Popes tried to exert their authority, but the kings in combination with their people (especially the middle classes) overthrew the power of the Pope and made their national churches independent of his authority.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-140" class="calibre10"></a>Heavy religious taxation alienated the growing capitalist class, the peasantry, the bourgeoisie, and the aristocracy. Certain Protestant sects encouraged economic individualism, and contested the restrictions that the clergy had imposed upon commercial pursuits. They demanded the removal of the ban on personal wealth gained through commercial occupations, and were willing to permit monetary profits for the businessman. Since much of the Church money was collected from the middle classes or the bourgeoisie, the members of this powerful group welcomed the opportunity to oppose the Church for financial reasons, if for no other.</p>
<p class="indent">Between 1305 and 1378, a great catastrophe overwhelmed the papacy. With the election of Clement V, the papacy fell into the hands of the French, and the seat of Church was moved from Rome to Avignon (in France). Due to this event, the Church came to be dominated by the French. Why, for example, should the English or Spanish submit to a French Pope and furnish him money to live in luxury? National governments all over Europe passed laws to limit or, in some cases, to prevent papal intervention in the affairs of the state altogether.</p>
<p class="indent">When the churchmen finally emerged out of their ‘Babylonian Captivity’ at Avignon (the above incident is known by this name in world history), they were confronted with other problems. In the ensuing confusion, two Popes were elected; one representing French interests and the other representing Italian interests. The Great Western Schism (1378&ndash;1415), the name given to this period of confusion, resulted in strifes that were carried even to the battlefield. For the Church, this was not only a severe test of its material powers but also a scandal. The Church was supposedly a single organisation established by Christ, with a Pope as his successor on earth. People lost respect for the institution and turned to heresies. The great schism was healed but the power of the papacy was never completely restored. Heresies grew in number and became increasingly threatening to the universal authority of the Church.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How and where did it Begin?</b></i></span> It was inevitable that the Reformation should start in Germany. For, many Germans were not good Roman Catholics, either by temperament or by training. They were sufficiently far from Rome to make contacts difficult. Germans lacked a strong centralised government to aid the Church in carrying out its decrees. Besides, it was the home of Martin Luther (1483&ndash;1545), a fearless and dynamic critic of the Church.</p>
<p class="indent">Several of the German princes were itching for civil war, and they eyed the work of Luther as a good excuse. If all the parties were in favour of peace, the theological issues might have been settled. Nobles and peasants also, for disparate reasons, supported Luther. Hostilities broke out between Catholic and Protestant States but peace was temporarily restored at the Peace of Augsburg (1555). According to this agreement, each prince might dictate the religion he wished his subjects to have, provided that it was either Lutheranism or Roman Catholicism. Lutheranism was thus recognised, and its rights were defined. The rebellion did not stop there. For, Luther’s influence reached beyond the territorial limits of Germany. Lutheranism, as a result, spread into other countries, especially to the Scandinavian states, where it was more generally accepted than in Germany.</p>
<p class="indent">Protestantism, by its very nature, was conducive to the rise and growth of several sects. Other than Lutherans, two other large groups developed, viz. the Calvinists and the Anglicans. Calvinism, unlike Lutheranism, was not the product of one man, as the name might suggest. The foundation for the rise of Calvinism was laid by Zwingli (1458&ndash;1531). He preached against fasting, celibacy of the clergy, and veneration of saints. He insisted strongly than Luther on the supreme authority of the Bible, and diverged radically from the form <a id="calibre_link-141" class="calibre10"></a>of service in the Catholic Church. His work was renewed in 1536 by Calvin (1509&ndash;1564) with more aggressiveness than he himself had shown. Calvinism soon spread to France, the Netherlands, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Scotland and England.</p>
<p class="indent">Anglicism was another form adopted by the third large group of the Protestant sects. It became the faith and order of the established Church of England and the Protestant Episcopal Church in the USA, and from it originated the Methodist Church. In many respects, Anglicism was more conservative and evolutionary than either Lutheranism or Calvinism, besides being highly nationalistic.</p>
<p class="indent">During the reign of Henry VII of Tudor Dynasty differences arose between the Catholic Church and the King, but it was not until the reign of Henry VIII (1509&ndash;1547) that a definite break came and then on the seemingly insignifi- cant question of his marital relationship. Henry VIII declared himself head of the church when the Pope refused to allow him to divorce his wife, Catherine. His reign was followed by long conflict between Catholics and Protestants. In 1559, Queen Elizabeth I established the Church of England as the official Church. Religious conflicts continued to rock England and the continent for another century. By 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Century, half of Europe had adopted one or the other form of Protestantism.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Significance?</b></i></span> One of the important offshoots of Reformation was Counter-Reformation or Catholic Reformation as opposed to Protestant Reformation. There were many loyal Catholics who did not want to break away from the Church but felt the urgent need for reform from within. The Council of Trent (1545&ndash;1563), a council summoned by the Church at Trent in Northern Italy to bring <a id="calibre_link-142" class="calibre10"></a>about reforms, earnestly undertook to remove some of the most glaring abuses and to restore unity in the Church. The representatives affirmed the main points in Catholic theology, but condemned the sale of Church offices and demanded that the clergy adhere more strictly to their duties.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00100.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">European Reformation</p>
<p class="indent">A number of orders were also established. ‘The Society of Jesus’, founded by Ignatius Loyola (1491&ndash;1556), was one of the most important orders. Strict and unquestioning obedience, as of a soldier in the army, was required for its members. They sought to enhance the power of the Roman Catholic Church through the establishment of schools and missionary work. Their influence spread as far as the Americas and the Orient. Thus, the Catholic Reformation cured the Roman Catholic Church of several of its ills. If it had taken place earlier, the strength of the Protestant cause could have been mitigated. The success of the Counter Reformation could be measured, to a degree, by the fact that the rapid spread of Protestantism was halted.</p>
<p class="indent">The unity of Christendom and the universality of the Church became things of the past. The uniformity in doctrines, dogmas and rituals also came to an end. There was a split in the Church into Protestantism and Catholicism. These two groups further broke up into many sects. National Churches were set up in many countries with their own doctrines, principles and sacraments. The heads of these Churches were the rulers of these countries, and not the Pope. Supremacy of the Pope was now replaced by that of the Bible.</p>
<p class="indent">While the influence, authority, power and prestige of the papacy was undermined, the spirit of nationalism and the absolute monarchies were enormously strengthened. The Act of Supremacy in England and the Peace of Augsburg in Germany led to the establishment of national churches and later on of the national states.</p>

<p class="indent">Rivalries between the two major groups of Christians gave rise to intolerance, fanaticism and hatred. They committed cruel acts in the name of God and discipline. The Catholic Inquisition was responsible for the persecution of Protestants and they were burnt alive at the stake. Mary Tudor of England is known as ‘Bloody-Mary’ in history because of her bloody deeds of persecuting the Protestants. The Protestants, too, did not follow a policy of religious toleration towards the Catholics, who had, to suffer many hardships during the reign of Edward VI of England. With the passage of time, both Reformation and Counter-Reformation movements became aggressive. The result was the long and bloody civil wars and revolts in many countries, especially in France, Germany, and Switzerland, among the supporters of the two sects. They caused great loss of life and property, and hampered all-round progress.</p>
<p class="indent">It saw the beginning of many religious wars among the Christian European countries. King Philip II of Spain was a staunch supporter of the Catholic Church. He was determined to conquer England and put an end to Protestantism in England. He also wanted to check the spread of Protestantism in his dominions, particularly in the Netherlands. Though he succeeded in destroying Protestantism in Spain, he did not succeed either in conquering England and putting an end to Protestantism there or in checking the spread of Protestantism in Holland. Again, when the Protestants of Bohemia rebelled against the Holy Roman Emperor, the rulers of Sweden and Denmark helped the Protestants. Later on, the Catholic France also joined fray, by supporting the Holy Roman Emperor. This was known as the ‘Thirty Years War’ and came to an end by the Treaty of West Phalia in 1648 A.D. Calvinism was also recognised as another branch of Christianity, and the rulers of German states were given the freedom to choose Catholicism or Luther-anism or Calvinism as their state religion.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-18">EMERGENCE OF A SCIENTIFIC VIEW OF THE WORLD AND THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a">General Survey</h3>
<p class="noindent">Western man’s view of himself and his world underwent great changes during the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries. Man slowly turned his mind and efforts from religion to problems and descriptions of the natural world. These changes of thought led to attack on the authority of the <a id="calibre_link-144" class="calibre10"></a>ancient thinkers and in some cases, attacks on Christianity. Two great themes combined to cause changes in man’s view. The first was the scientific view that, through proper methods, man could constantly improve himself and his world. The other was that all the laws of nature and the problems facing man could be explained and solved by man’s mind through logic and reason.</p>
<p class="indent">The new thinkers created a different method of thought from the ancients. In the field of astronomy, they started basing their findings on measurements, observations and experiments. Arguing that the popular belief that earth was the centre of the universe was ‘unpleasing to the mind’, Nicolaus Copernicus in the 1500s stated that the planets moved around the sun. Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilee agreed and established laws describing planetary motion, inertia, and acceleration. The study of planetary motion reached its climax with the work of the English scientist Isaac Newton. Writing in 1687, Newton improved and worked out the laws describing inertia and gravity. The success of this logical attack upon the workings of the universe caused men to begin to apply reason to other areas of thought and living.</p>
<p class="indent">Even man’s idea of himself was questioned. Rene Descartes, a Frenchman, wanted to know how the mind could understand what the body tells about the outside world if the mind and the body have different properties. Descartes began to doubt everything he had learned, but he could not doubt that he was thinking. His words, ‘I think, therefore I am’, show the one thing man knows about himself. John Locke in England, exploring this problem further, believed that man’s mind is ‘blank’ when he is born and that society, through education and religion, places all knowledge in man’s mind. If this were true, thinkers reasoned that better education would make better men. Immanuel Kant, a German philosopher, explained the role that reason plays in man’s understanding of what his senses perceive or see. Kant’s work began modern man’s understanding of the use of reason and logic.</p>
<p class="indent">Some men analysed the role of governments with this system of reason. Locke argued that government was created to protect man’s ‘natural rights’. Montesquieu said good government must have separation of powers to keep rulers from becoming too strong. Governments must listen to their people, Jean Jacques Rousseau stated, because the people have ‘natural goodness’ and are ‘sovereign,’ or supreme. The thinkers of the Age of Enlightenment gave man the vision of his own never ending improvement. This vision changed the history of Western man forever.</p>
<h3 class="h3a">Scientific View</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is it?</b></i></span> In modern civilisation, almost everything is approached from a scientific view. Scientific progress does not mean only accumulation of knowledge and perfection of mechanical instruments, but also establishment of a scientific attitude on the part of the people. Throughout the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, a steady growth of knowledge and a general clearing up of man’s ideas about the world in which they lived was in progress in the European world. This gradual emergence of a scientific view of the world went on disconnected from political life, and producing no striking immediate results. Nor was it affecting popular thought very profoundly during the period. These reactions were to come later and only in their full force in the latter half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. It was a process that went on chiefly in a small world of prosperous and independent-spirited people. In this process, universities played a part but not a leading part. Endowed learning is prone to be timid and conservative unless it has the spur of contact with independent minds.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Emerge?</b></i></span> The primary cause in its emergence is the growth of philosophical thought. A brief survey of the main <a id="calibre_link-145" class="calibre10"></a>philosophical trends will drive home the point. From times immemorial, there have been three important attitudes towards life, viz. supernaturalism, humanism and naturalism. The first one, the oldest and most primitive of the three, has never lost its hold on people, particularly the uninformed masses. It is based on the concept that theistic authority rules the forces of nature and salvation of the soul was the primary purpose of life. Naturally there is no meeting point between the scientific view and this supernatural attitude. The second one advanced first by the Greeks and then revived by the Renaissance men, assumed that man was the measure of all things, emphasising secularism rather than other worldliness. While the humanist attitude was not necessarily scientific, it fostered science. The third approach, which was also Greek in origin, did not play any significant part till the dawn of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Century. The forces of nature, according to naturalism, operated according to fixed laws. Life, in its fullest sense, can be realised only by controlling natural forces. This means the glorification of science.</p>
<p class="indent">Philosophy by itself could not give rise to scientific view. The proper setting and the necessary demand for its services were equally in need for its emergence.</p>
<p class="indent">The expansion of Europe and the commercial revolution gave scientists the much needed opportunity, while the establishment of law and order by the new nation-state provided them the security. The newly risen middle classes provided patronage to them. Above all, the importance of the contributions of many pioneer scientists cannot be forgotten. Many scientists gave up their lives because they were branded as heretics.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How and where did it Emerge?</b></i></span> The British and the French were the pioneers in the emergence of the scientific view, but soon the Germans, who had earned humility under Napoleon, showed so much enthusiasm and perseverance in scientific inquiry that they were able to overtake the leaders. Though this work of research and experiment was making Britain and France the most powerful and richest countries in the world, it was not making scientists prosperous. A scientist is normally unworldly, for he is too preoccupied with his research to plan and scheme how to make money out of it. Therefore, the economic exploitation of his inventions falls very easily and naturally into the hands of the more worldly type. For such men, inventors and discoverers came by nature for cleverer people to make profit.</p>
<p class="indent">In this matter, the Germans proved themselves to be better. German intelligentsia did not display the same attitude towards new learning. They promoted its development and the German entrepreneurs had not quite the same contempt for the man of science as had his British competitors. Knowledge, these Germans believed, was like cultivated crop, responsive to fertilisers. They did concede, therefore, a certain amount of proceeds to the scientists; their public expenditure was abundantly rewarded. By the second half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the German scientific workers had made German a necessary language for every science student who wished to keep abreast with the latest work in his field. In certain branches, and particularly in chemistry, Germany established her undisputed superiority over her Western neighbours.</p>
<h3 class="h3a">The Enlightenment</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was it?</b></i></span> The late 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century saw the sparks of interest in natural sciences and rational thinking flourished leading to an age of Enlightenment. This dominated the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and paved the way for a revolutionary era in politics and society. The leaders of the Enlightenment believed that they lived in an enlightened age. For them the past was largely steeped in superstition and ignorance and saw their age as a time when people were moving <a id="calibre_link-146" class="calibre10"></a>from darkness into light. They were imbued with the idea of progress.</p>
<p class="indent">The Enlightenment was a time of positive thought. It began to be assumed that the condition of human beings would improve steadily so that each generation would be better off than the previous one. This progress would be achieved by the use of man’s rational thinking. Faith in reason was a crucial characteristic of the Enlightenment Age. Indeed the twin concepts of Enlightenment were progress and reason.</p>
<p class="indent">The exponents of these twin concepts were an extremely articulate group, known as the ‘<i class="calibre8">philosophes</i>’, who are not to be confused with philosophers in the academic sense. These were not profound or systematic thinkers in any special branch of knowledge. They were mostly literary men or popularisers&mdash;more journalists than philosophers. The ‘<i class="calibre8">philosophes</i>’ were vehemently opposed to the prevailing system and they penned down plays, novels, essays and histories to popularise their ideas and demonstrate to the people the need for change.</p>
<p class="indent">Among the large number of people who devoted themselves to the acquisition of ‘natural knowledge’, Newton was undoubtedly the most influential. The ‘<i class="calibre8">philosophes</i>’ were greatly influenced by his law of gravitation and believed in the existence of natural laws that regulated not only the physical universe, but also human society. All people’s institutions and traditions had to stand the test of reason. The ‘<i class="calibre8">philosophes</i>’ subjected the ancient regime in France and throughout Europe to a barrage of devastating criticism. More importantly, they evolved a set of revolutionary principles by which they proposed to effect a total reorganisation of society. Their proposals for change in the areas of religion, economy and government are of particular interest.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was Enlightenment Achieved?</b></i></span> Their key slogan in economics was ‘<i class="calibre8">laissez faire</i>’ or freedom for the people to do what they will with no interference form the government. This was in reaction to the strict regulation of economic life generally known as ‘Mercantilism’. During the formative phase of the nation state, Mercantilism was considered as essential for national security. By the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, it seemed superfluous and detrimental to growth. The best known defence of <i class="calibre8">laissez fai</i>re was made by the Scotsman Adam Smith in his classic work, ‘<i class="calibre8">An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i>’ (1776). His argument was that individuals are motivated by self-interest so far as their economic activities are concerned, that the national welfare is simply the sum of all the individual aspirations operating within a nation and that each man knows his own interest better than anybody else does.</p>
<p class="indent">Religion too underwent reform in this period. The key slogan here was ‘<i class="calibre8">ecrasez l’ infame</i>’ or ‘crush the infamous’. The demand was for the stamping out of religious fanaticism and intolerance. The ‘<i class="calibre8">philosophes’</i> opposed the traditional belief that God controls the universe and arbitrarily determines the fate of humanity. Instead, they sought a rational approach to religion. Consequently, a variety of radical departures were made from religious orthodoxy. Some became atheists, denouncing the existence of God and condemning religion as a tool of priests and politicians; others became agnostics&mdash;neither denying nor affirming the existence of God. But the majority were deists, willing to concede that God allowed the universe to function according to certain natural laws and refrained from intervention. Thus, the deists accepted God amid the teachings of Christianity while simultaneously rejecting supernatural features such as the virgin birth, the resurrection, the divinity of Christ and the divine inspiration of the Bible. What is important to all these new dogmas; atheism, agnosticism and deism is that they reflected the spurt in skepticism regarding ‘revealed’ or <a id="calibre_link-147" class="calibre10"></a>‘supernatural’ religion. Thus, for the first time since the triumph of Christianity in Europe, a definite break with the Christian tradition took place.</p>
<p class="indent">In the field of politics, too, they had a key phrase&mdash;the ‘social contract’. The contract theory of government, which was not new and was formulated by the English political theorist, John Locke, in his ‘<i class="calibre8">Essay on Civil Government</i>’, was a political contract between the rulers and the ruled. Jean Jacques Rousseau, the French philosopher, changed it into a social rather than a political contract. Social contract, for him, meant an agreement amongst the people themselves. In his ‘<i class="calibre8">Social Contract</i>’ (1726), Rousseau regarded government merely as a ‘commission’ by which he justified revolution as a restoration of their rightful power to the sovereign people.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Significance?</b></i></span> This general review of the revolutionary thought sweeping Europe suggests the significance of the Enlightenment for European history. The slogans ‘<i class="calibre8">ecrasez l’ infame</i>’, ‘<i class="calibre8">laissez faire</i>’ and ‘social contract’ were subversive of traditional thought, practices and institutions. Besides, they denoted a threat to the status quo, not only in France, but throughout Europe and even the world. As a matter of fact, these ‘<i class="calibre8">philosophes’</i> considered themselves not as Frenchmen or Englishmen but as members of the humanity. In other words, they thought and acted in global rather than Western terms and sought to discover social laws that had universal application like Newton’s laws of the physical world.</p>
<p class="indent">Though the ‘<i class="calibre8">philosophes</i>’ did not come up with any laws governing all mankind, their writings did leave a mark in many parts of the world. Their greatest success lay in being able to persuade many European monarchs to accept at least some of their theories. These monarchs, though still believed in divine right theory, changed their ideas about the purpose of their rule. Governmental authority was to remain with the kings but now it was to be used for the benefit of the people. These kings, therefore, came to be known as <i class="calibre8">benevolent despots</i>. Frederick the Great of Prussia (1740&ndash;1786), Catherine the Great of Russia (1762&ndash;1796) and Joseph II of Austria (1765&ndash;1790) were the most prominent among them.</p>
<p class="indent">The legacy of the Age of Enlightenment was manifold. First, sensualist psychology and the idea of conditioning man’s development through societal laws became integral to the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century thought. Secondly, scientific speculation of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century was a step toward the future, but for the most part had little permanent value except in its materialism and in the dawning idea of evolution. Thirdly, moral speculation gave birth to the Utilitarianism that remained a powerful undercurrent, emerging again after World War I. Fourthly, the development of the tenets of both liberal democracy and totalitarian democracy (or collectivism) was promoted during the Enlightenment. Franklin, Jefferson, Adams and Madison found ideas on political and civil rights a rational and just society, representation and popular sovereignty as expressed in suffrage. Karl Marx, another spiritual son of the Enlightenment, stimulated its speculative proto-totalitarianism with the doctrine of class struggle, economic determinism and dialectical materialism.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-19">RISE AND GROWTH OF MAJOR IDEAS: KANT &amp; ROUSSEAU</h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a">General Survey</h3>
<p class="noindent">The scientific and intellectual developments of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century &ndash; the discoveries of Isaac Newton, the rationalism of Rene Descartes, the skepticism of Pierre Bayle, the pantheism of Benedict <i class="calibre8">de</i> Spinoza, and the empiricism of Francis Bacon and John Locke-fostered the belief in natural law and universal order and the confidence in human reason that spread to influence all of 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century society. Currents of thought were many and varied, but certain ideas may be characterised as pervading and <a id="calibre_link-148" class="calibre10"></a>dominant. A rational and scientific approach to religious, social, political, and economic issues promoted a secular view of the world and a general sense of progress and perfectibility.</p>
<p class="indent">The major champions of these concepts were the ‘<i class="calibre8">philosophes’</i>, who popularised and promulgated the new ideas for the general reading public. These proponents of the Enlightenment shared certain basic attitudes. With supreme faith in rationality, they sought to discover and to act upon universally valid principles governing humanity, nature, and society. They variously attacked spiritual and scientific authority, dogmatism, intolerance, censorship, and economic and social restraints. They considered the state the proper and rational instrument of progress. The extreme rationalism and skepticism of the age led naturally to deism; the same qualities played a part in bringing the later reaction of romanticism. The <i class="calibre8">Encyclopedie</i> of Denis Diderot epitomised the spirit of the Age of Enlightenment, or Age of Reason, as it is also called.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Roots?</b></i></span> Although the intellectual movement called ‘Enlightenment’, is usually associated with the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, its roots, in fact, go back much further. But before we explore those roots, we need to define the term. This is one of those rare historical movements which in fact named itself. Certain thinkers and writers, primarily in London and Paris, believed that they were more enlightened than their compatriots and set out to enlighten them. They believed that human reason could be used to combat ignorance, superstition, and tyranny and to build a better world. Their principal targets were religion (embodied in France in the Catholic Church) and the domination of society by a hereditary aristocracy.</p>
<p class="indent">To understand why this movement became so influential in the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, it is important to go back in time. We could choose almost any starting point, but let us begin with the recovery of Aristotelian logic by Thomas Aquinas in the 13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. In his hands the logical procedures so carefully laid out by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle were used to defend the dogmas of Christianity; and for the next couple of centuries, other thinkers pursued these goals to shore up every aspect of faith with logic. These thinkers were sometimes called ‘schoolmen’ (more formally, ‘scholastics,’) and Voltaire frequently refers to them as ‘doctors,’ by which he means ‘doctors of theology.’ Unfortunately for the Catholic Church, the tools of logic could not be confined to the uses it preferred. After all, they had been developed in Athens, in a pagan culture which had turned them on its own traditional beliefs. It was only a matter of time before Europeans did the same.</p>
<p class="indent">In the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, there emerged in Italy and France a group of thinkers known as the ‘humanists.’ The term did not then have anti-religious associations it has in contemporary political debate. Almost all of them were practicing Catholics. They argued that the proper worship of God involved admiration of his creation, particularly the crown of creation: humanity. By celebrating the human race and its capacities, they argued, they were worshipping God more appropriately than gloomy priests and monks who harped on original sin and continuously called upon people to confess and humble themselves before the Almighty. Indeed, some of them claimed that humans were like God, created not only in his image, but with a share of his creative power. The painter, the architect, the musician, and the scholar, by exercising their intellectual powers, were fulfilling divine purposes. This celebration of human capacity, though it was mixed in the Renaissance with elements of gloom and superstition (witchcraft trials flourished in this period as they never had during the Middle Ages), was to bestow a powerful legacy on Europeans. The goal of Renaissance humanists was to recapture some of the pride, breadth of spirit, and creativity of the ancient Greeks <a id="calibre_link-149" class="calibre10"></a>and Romans, to replicate their successes and go beyond them. Europeans developed the belief that tradition could and should be used to promote change. By cleaning and sharpening the tools of antiquity, they could reshape their own time.</p>
<p class="indent">Galileo Galilee, for instance, was used the same sort of logic the schoolmen had used&ndash;reinforced with observation&mdash;to argue in 1632 for the Copernican notion that the earth rotates on its axis beneath the unmoving sun. The Church, and most particularly the Holy Inquisition, objected that the Bible clearly stated that the sun moved through the sky and denounced Galileo’s teachings, forcing him to <i class="calibre8">recant</i> (take back) what he had written and preventing him from teaching further. The Church’s triumph was a pyrrhic victory, for though it could silence Galileo, it could not prevent the advance of science (though most of those advances would take place in Protestant northern Europe, out of the reach of the Pope and his Inquisition). Before Galileo’s time, in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, various humanists had begun to ask dangerous questions. Francois Rabelais, a French monk and physician influenced by Protestantism, but spurred on by his own rebelliousness, challenged the Church’s authority in his <i class="calibre8">Gargantua and Pantagruel,</i> ridiculing many religious doctrines as absurd.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Background of Major Ideas?</b></i></span> During the late Middle Ages, peasants had begun to move from rural estates to the towns in search of increased freedom and prosperity. As trade and communication improved during the Renaissance, the ordinary town-dweller began to realise that things need not always go on as they had for centuries. New charters could be written, new governments formed, new laws passed, new businesses begun. Although each changed institution quickly tried to stabilise its power by claiming the support of tradition, the pressure for change continued to mount. It was not only contact with alien cultural patterns which influenced Europeans, it was the wealth brought back from Asia and the Americas, which catapulted a new class of merchants into prominence, partially displacing the old aristocracy whose power had been rooted in the ownership of land. These merchants had their own ideas about the sort of world they wanted to inhabit, and they became major agents of change, in the arts, in government, and in the economy.</p>
<p class="indent">They were naturally convinced that their earnings were the result of their individual merit and hard work, unlike the inherited wealth of traditional aristocrats. Whereas individualism had been chiefly emphasised in the Renaissance by artists, especially visual artists, it now became a core value. The ability of individual effort to transform the world became a European dogma, lasting to this day.</p>
<p class="indent">The chief obstacles to the reshaping of Europe by the merchant class were the same as those faced by the rationalist philosophers: absolutist kings and dogmatic Churches. The struggle was complex and many-sided, with each participant absorbing many of the others’ values; but the general trend was clear: individualism, freedom and change replaced community, authority, and tradition as core European values. Religion survived, but weakened and often transformed almost beyond recognition; the monarchy was to dwindle over the course of the hundred years beginning in the mid-18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century to a pale shadow of its former self.</p>
<p class="indent">This is the background of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century Enlightenment. Europeans were changing, but Europe’s institutions were not keeping pace with that change. The Church insisted that it was the only source of truth, that all who lived outside its bounds were damned, while it was apparent to any reasonably sophisticated person that most human beings on earth were not and had never been Christians&mdash;yet they had built great and inspiring civilisations. Writers <a id="calibre_link-150" class="calibre10"></a>and speakers grew restive at the omnipresent censorship and sought whatever means they could to evade or even denounce it.</p>
<p class="indent">Most important, the middle classes&mdash;the <i class="calibre8">bourgeoisie</i>&mdash;were painfully aware that they were paying taxes to support a fabulously expensive aristocracy which contributed nothing of value to society (beyond, perhaps, its patronage of the arts, which the burghers of Holland had shown could be equally well exercised by themselves), and that those useless aristocrats were unwilling to share power with those who actually managed and&mdash;to their way of thinking&mdash;created the national wealth. They were to find ready allies in France among the impoverished masses who may have lived and thought much like their ancestors, but who were all too aware that with each passing year they were paying higher and higher taxes to support a few thousand at Versailles in idle dissipation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did the Ideas Rise &amp; Grow?</b></i></span> Michel <i class="calibre8">de</i> Montaigne, in a much more quiet and modest but ultimately more subversive way, asked a single question over and over again in his <i class="calibre8">Essays:</i> ‘What do I know?’ By this he meant that we have no right to impose on others, dogmas which rest on cultural habit rather than absolute truth. Powerfully influenced by the discovery of thriving non-Christian cultures in places as far off as Brazil, he argued that morals may be to some degree relative. Who are Europeans to insist that Brazilian cannibals who merely consume dead human flesh instead of wasting it are morally inferior to Europeans who persecute and oppress those of whom they disapprove? This shift toward cultural relativism, though it was based on scant understanding of the newly discovered people, continued to have a profound effect on the European thought to the present day. Indeed, it is one of the hallmarks of the Enlightenment. Just as their predecessors had used the tools of antiquity to gain unprecedented freedom of inquiry, the Enlightenment thinkers used the examples of other cultures to gain freedom to reshape not only their philosophies, but their societies. It was becoming clear that there was nothing inevitable about the European patterns of thought and living: there were many possible ways of being human, and doubtless new ones could be invented.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00089.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Descartes</p>
<p class="indent">The other contribution of Montaigne to the Enlightenment stemmed from another aspect of his famous question: ‘What do I know?’ If we cannot be certain that our values are God-given, then we have no right to impose them by force on others. Inquisitors, Popes, and kings alike had no business enforcing adherence to particular religious or philosophical beliefs.</p>
<p class="indent">It is one of the great paradoxes of history that radical doubt was necessary for the new sort of certainty called ‘scientific.’ The good scientist is the one who is willing to test all assumptions, to challenge all traditional opinion, to get closer to the truth. If ultimate truth, such as was claimed by religious thinkers, was unattainable by scientists, so much the better. In a sense, the strength of science at its best is that it is always aware of its limits, aware that knowledge is always growing, always subject to change; never absolute. Since knowledge depends on evidence and reason, arbitrary authority can only be its enemy.</p>
<p class="indent">René Descartes, in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, attempted to use reason as the schoolmen had, to shore up his faith, but much more rigorously than had been attempted before. He tried to begin with a blank slate, with the bare minimum of knowledge: the knowledge of his own existence (‘<i class="calibre8">I think, therefore I am</i>’). From there, he attempted to reason his way to a complete defence of Christianity, but to do so <a id="calibre_link-151" class="calibre10"></a>he committed so many logical faults that his successors over the centuries were to slowly disintegrate his gains, even finally challenging the notion of selfhood with which he had begun. The history of philosophy from his time to the early 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century is partly the story of more and more ingenious logic proving less and less, until Ludwig Wittgenstein succeeded in undermining the very bases of philosophy itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Here we are concerned with early stages in the process in which it seemed that logic could be a powerful avenue to truth. To be sure, logic alone could be used to defend all sorts of absurd notions; and Enlightenment thinkers insisted on combining it with something they called ‘reason’ which consisted of common sense, observation, and their own unacknowledged prejudices in favour of skepticism and freedom.</p>
<p class="indent">We have been focusing closely on a thin trickle of thought which travelled through an era otherwise dominated by dogma and fanaticism. The 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century was torn by witch-hunts and wars of religion and imperial conquest. Protestants and Catholics denounced each other as followers of Satan, and people could be imprisoned for attending the wrong church, or for not attending any. All publications, whether pamphlets or scholarly volumes, were subject to prior censorship by both Church and state, often working hand in hand. Slavery was widely practiced, especially in the colonial plantations of the Western Hemisphere, and its cruelties frequently defended by leading religious figures. The despotism of monarchs exercising far greater powers than any medieval king was supported by the doctrine of the ‘divine right of kings,’ and scripture quoted to show that revolution was detested by God. Speakers of sedition or blasphemy quickly found themselves imprisoned, or even executed. Organisations which tried to challenge the twin authorities of church and state were banned. There had been plenty of intolerance and dogma to go around in the Middle Ages, but the emergence of the modern state made its tyranny much more efficient and powerful.</p>
<p class="indent">It was inevitable that sooner or later many Europeans would begin to weary of the repression and warfare carried out in the name of absolute truth. In addition, though Protestants had begun by making powerful critiques of Catholicism, they quickly turned their guns on each other, producing a bewildering array of Churches each claiming the exclusive path to salvation. It was natural that people tossed from one demanding faith to another to wonder whether any of the Churches deserved the authority they claimed, and to begin to prize the scepticism of Montaigne over the certainty of Luther or Calvin. Meanwhile, there were other powerful forces at work in Europe: economic ones which were to interact profoundly with these intellectual trends.</p>
<p class="indent">Interestingly, it was among those very idle aristocrats that the French Enlightenment philosophers were to find some of their earliest and most enthusiastic followers. Despite the fact that the Church and State were more often than not allied with each other, they were keenly aware of their differences. Even kings could on occasion be attracted by arguments which seemed to undermine the authority of the Church. The fact that the aristocrats were utterly unaware of the precariousness of their position also made them overconfident, interested in dabbling in the new ideas partly simply because they were new and exciting.</p>
<p class="indent">Voltaire moved easily in these aristocratic circles, dining at their tables, taking a titled mistress, corresponding with monarchs. He opposed tyranny and dogma, but he had no notion of reinventing that discredited Athenian folly, democracy. He had far too little faith in the ordinary person for that. What he did think was that educated and sophisticated persons could be brought to see through the exercise of <a id="calibre_link-152" class="calibre10"></a>their reason that the world could and should be greatly improved.</p>
<p class="indent">Not all Enlightenment thinkers were like Voltaire in this. His chief adversary was Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who distrusted the aristocrats not out of a thirst for change but because he believed they were betraying decent traditional values. He opposed the theater which was Voltaire’s lifeblood, shunned the aristocracy which Voltaire courted, and argued for something dangerously like democratic revolution. Whereas Voltaire argued that equality was impossible, Rousseau argued that inequality was not only unnatural, but that&mdash;when taken too far&mdash;it made decent government impossible. Whereas Voltaire charmed with his wit, Rousseau ponderously insisted on his correctness, even while contradicting himself. Whereas Voltaire insisted on the supremacy of the intellect, Rousseau emphasised on the emotions, becoming a contributor to both the Enlightenment and its successor, Romanticism. Whereas Voltaire endlessly repeated the same handful of core Enlightenment notions, Rousseau sparked off original thoughts in all directions: ideas about education, the family, government, the arts, and whatever else attracted his attention.</p>
<p class="indent">For all their personal differences, the two shared more values than they liked to acknowledge. They viewed absolute monarchy as dangerous and evil and rejected orthodox Christianity. Though Rousseau often struggled to seem more devout, he was almost as much a sceptic as Voltaire: the minimalist faith both shared was called ‘deism,’ and it was eventually to transform European religion and have powerful influences on other aspects of society as well. Across the border in Holland, merchants who exercised most political power made a successful industry out of publishing books that could not be printed in countries like France. Dissenting religious groups mounted radical attacks on Christian orthodoxy.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Spread in Various Countries?</b></i></span> Centred in Paris, the movement gained international character at cosmopolitan salons. Masonic lodges played an important role in disseminating new ideas throughout Europe. Foremost in France among proponents of the Enlightenment were Baron <i class="calibre8">de</i> Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Comte <i class="calibre8">de</i> Buffon; Baron Turgot and other physiocrats, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who greatly influenced romanticism. Many opposed the extreme materialism of Julien <i class="calibre8">de La</i> Mettrie, Baron Holbach, and Claude Helvetius.</p>
<p class="indent">In England, the coffeehouses and the newly flourishing press stimulated social and political criticism, such as the urbane commentary of Joseph Addison and Sir Richard Steele. Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope were influential Tory satirists. Lockean theories of learning by sense perception were further developed by David Hume. The philosophical view of human rationality as being in harmony with the universe created a hospitable climate for the <i class="calibre8">laissez-faire</i> economics of Adam Smith and for the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham. Historical writing gained secular detachment in the work of Edward Gibbon.</p>
<p class="indent">In Germany, the universities became centres of the Enlightenment. Moses Mendelssohn set forth a doctrine of rational progress; G. E. Lessing advanced a natural religion of morality; Johann Herder developed a philosophy of cultural nationalism. The supreme importance of the individual formed the basis of the ethics of Immanuel Kant. Italian representatives of the age included Cesare Beccaria and Giambattista Vico. From America, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin exerted vast international influence.</p>
<p class="indent">Some ‘<i class="calibre8">philosophes</i>’ at first proposed that their theories be implemented by enlightened despotic rulers who would impose reform by authoritarian means. Czar Peter I of Russia anticipated the trend, and Holy Roman <a id="calibre_link-153" class="calibre10"></a>Emperor Joseph II was the prototype of the enlightened despot; others were Frederick II of Prussia, Catherine II of Russia, and Charles III of Spain. The proponents of the Enlightenment have often been held responsible for the French Revolution. Certainly the Age of Enlightenment can be seen as a major demarcation in the emergence of the modern world.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Great Britain had developed its own Enlightenment, fostered by thinkers like the English thinker John Locke, the Scot David Hume, and many others. England had anticipated the rest of Europe by deposing and decapitating its king back in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Although the monarchy had eventually been restored, this experience created a certain openness toward change in many places that could not be entirely extinguished. English Protestantism struggled to express itself in ways that widened the limits of freedom of speech and press. Radical Quakers and Unitarians broke open old dogmas in ways that Voltaire was to find highly congenial when he found himself there in exile. The English and French Enlightenments exchanged influences through many channels, Voltaire not least among them. Since England had gotten its revolution out of the way early, it was able to proceed more smoothly and gradually down the road to democracy; but English liberty was dynamite when transported to France, where resistance by Church and state was fierce to the last possible moment. Ironically the result was that while Britain remained saturated with class privilege and relatively pious, France was to become after its own revolution the most egalitarian and anti-clerical state in Europe&mdash;at least in its ideals. The power of religion and aristocracy diminished gradually in England while in France they were violently uprooted.</p>
<p class="indent">Across the Atlantic, many of the intellectual leaders of the American colonies were drawn to the Enlightenment. The colonies may have been founded by leaders of various dogmatic religious persuasions, but when it became necessary to unite against England, it was apparent that no one of them could prevail over the others, and that the most desirable course was to agree to disagree. Nothing more powerfully impelled the movement toward the separation of Church and State than the realisation that no one church could dominate this new state. Many of the most distinguished leaders of the American revolution&mdash;Jefferson, Washington, Franklin, Paine&mdash;were powerfully influenced by English and&mdash;to a lesser extent&mdash;French Enlightenment thought. The God who underwrites the concept of equality in the Declaration of Independence is the same deist God Rousseau worshipped, not that venerated in the traditional churches which still supported and defended monarchies all over Europe. Jefferson and Franklin both spent time in France&mdash;a natural ally because it was a traditional enemy of England&mdash;absorbing the influence of the French Enlightenment. The language of natural law, of inherent freedoms, of selfdetermination which seeped so deeply into the American grain was the language of the Enlightenment, though often coated with a light glaze of traditional religion, what has been called our ‘civil religion.’ This is one reason that Americans studied the Enlightenment. It is in their bones. It has defined part of what they have dreamed of, what they aim to become. Separated geographically from most of the aristocrats against whom they were rebelling, their revolution was to be far less corrosive&mdash;and at first less influential&mdash;than that in France.</p>
<p class="indent">But we need to return to the beginning of the story, to Voltaire and his allies in France, struggling to assert the values of freedom and tolerance in a culture where the twin fortresses of monarchy and Church opposed almost everything they stood for. To oppose the monarchy openly would be fatal; the Church was an easier target. Protestantism had made <a id="calibre_link-154" class="calibre10"></a>religious controversy familiar. Voltaire could skillfully cite one Christian against another to make his arguments. One way to undermine the power of the Church was to undermine its credibility, and thus Voltaire devoted a great deal of his time in attacking the fundamentals of Christian belief: the inspiration of the Bible, the incarnation of God in Jesus Christ, the damnation of unbelievers. No doubt he relished this battle partly for its own sake, but he never lost sight of his goal: the toppling of Church power to increase the freedom available to Europeans. Voltaire was joined by a band of rebellious thinkers known as the ‘<i class="calibre8">philosophes’:</i> Charles <i class="calibre8">de</i> Montesquieu, Pierre Bayle, Jean <i class="calibre8">d</i>’Alembert, and many lesser lights. Although ‘<i class="calibre8">philosophe</i>’, literally means ‘philosopher’, we use the French word in English to designate this particular group of French 18th-century thinkers. Since Denis Diderot commissioned many of them to write for his influential <i class="calibre8">Encyclopedia,</i> they are also known as ‘the Encyclopedists.’</p>
<h3 class="h3a">Immanuel Kant (1724&ndash;1804)</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is his Role in Enlightenment?</b></i></span> Complicated in thought but simple in lifestyle, Kant&mdash;who wrote and taught on a broad range of subjects from physics to metaphysics, from theology to philosophy&mdash;lived out his life in the relative confines of his hometown of Konigsberg, East Prussia (‘Kaliningrad’ since its Russian takeover towards the end of World War II).</p>
<p class="indent">In many ways, Kant’s intellectual life was shaped by the challenge that Hume had issued the world a quarter of a century earlier. In his <i class="calibre8">Critique of Pure Reason</i> (1781), Kant agreed with Hume’s empiricism&mdash;namely that sense-experience is essential to human knowledge. But he also agreed with the continental rationalists (most notably Leibniz, whose writings also were a major influence over Kant) that knowledge is also a matter of the exercise of human reason&mdash;in particular the use of innate human ideas (‘categories’) which help us to organise this empirical information. Thus Kant saw himself as closing the intellectual gap between the British empiricists and the Continental rationalists.</p>
<p class="indent">Kant also saw himself as answering Hume’s skepticism about ever knowing with any degree of certainty the truth of transcendent ideas, such as moral laws or ethical principles. In Kant’s, <i class="calibre8">Metaphysics of Morals</i> (1785) and <i class="calibre8">Critique of Practical Reason</i> (1788), he proposed a new moral/ethical ‘categorical imperative,’ one that did not require the existence of God for its validity. Yet Kant’s concept was of a definite transcendent nature, one with absolute universal validity. It involved an ingenious piece of moral logic: we ought to act in such a way that our act could become accepted as a universal principle of behaviour. If it were not able to attain such a universal validity (because, for instance, of an internal contradiction in logic) then that action, by ‘practical reason,’ was obviously not to be pursued.</p>
<p class="indent">Taking this logic of ‘practical reason’ a step further, he turned to the issue of the existence of God. He agreed with Hume that no rational argument could be given for God’s existence&mdash;that is, ‘pure reason’ could not build a case for God’s existence, ‘practical reason’ could. Pursuing a traditional line of reason that went back as far as Ockham in the early 1300s, Kant claimed that human reason cannot establish the ‘fact’ of God. In observing the moral instincts of people, we can see (through the eyes of faith) that there is ‘some kind’ of source beyond the mere human will itself that directs life. That higher moral grounding <a id="calibre_link-155" class="calibre10"></a>is by definition God. Thus God exists. (This kind of theological reasoning did not impress the Prussian government, which censured his work). Kant was so impressed that we humans could live in accordance with such higher moral imperatives that in his <i class="calibre8">Perpetual Peace</i> he laid out a vision for a new world order.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00115.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Immanuel Kant</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is his Contribution to Philosophy?</b></i></span> According to Kant, his reading of David Hume awakened him from his dogmatic slumber and set him on the road to becoming the critical philosopher, whose position can be seen as a synthesis of the Leibniz&ndash;Wolffian rationalism and the Humean scepticism. Kant termed his basic insight into the nature of knowledge, the Copernican revolution in philosophy.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of assuming that our ideas, to be true, must conform to an external reality independent of our knowing, Kant proposed that objective reality is known only insofar as it conforms to the essential structure of the knowing mind. He maintained that objects of experience-phenomena may be known, but that things lying beyond the realm of possible experience&mdash;or things-in-themselves&mdash;are unknowable, although their existence is a necessary presupposition. Phenomena that can be perceived in the pure forms of sensibility, space, and time must, if they are to be understood, possess the characteristics that constitute our categories of understanding. Those categories, which include causality and substance, are the source of the structure of phenomenal experience.</p>
<p class="indent">The scientist, therefore, may be sure only that the natural events observed are knowable in terms of the categories. Our field of knowledge, thus emancipated from Humean skepticism, is nevertheless limited to the world of phenomena. All theoretical attempts to know things-in-themselves are bound to fail. This inevitable failure is the Partial theme of <i class="calibre8">Critique of Pure Reason</i> entitled, the Transcendental Dialectic. Here Kant shows that the three great problems of metaphysics&mdash;God, freedom, and immortality&mdash;are insoluble by speculative thought. Their existence can be neither affirmed nor denied on theoretical grounds, nor can they be scientifically demonstrated, but Kant shows the necessity of a belief in their existence in his moral philosophy.</p>
<p class="indent">Kant’s ethics centres in his categorical imperative (or moral law)&mdash;act as if the maxim from which you act were to become through your will a universal law. This law has its source in the autonomy of a rational being, and it is the formula for an absolutely good will. However, since we are all members of two worlds, the sensible and the intelligible, we do not infallibly act in accordance with this law but, on the contrary, almost always act according to inclination. Thus what is objectively necessary, i.e., to will in conformity to the law, is subjectively contingent, and for this reason, the moral law confronts us as an ought.</p>
<p class="indent">In the <i class="calibre8">Critique of Practical Reason,</i> Kant went on to state that morality requires the belief in the existence of God, freedom, and immortality, because without their existence there can be no morality. In the <i class="calibre8">Critique of Judgment,</i> Kant applied his critical method to aesthetic and teleological judgments. The chief purpose of this work was to find a bridge between the sensible and the intelligible worlds, which are sharply distinguished in his theoretical and practical philosophy. This bridge is found in the concepts of beauty and purposiveness that suggest at least the possibility of an ultimate union of the two realms.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Impact of Kantian Philosophy?</b></i></span> The impact of Kant’s work has been incalculable. In addition to being the impetus to the development of German idealism by J. G. Fichte, F. W. Schelling, and G. W. F. Hegel, Kant’s philosophy has influenced almost every area of thought. Among the major outgrowths of Kant’s work was the Neo-Kantianism of the late 19th century This movement had many branches in Germany, France, and Italy; the two <a id="calibre_link-156" class="calibre10"></a>chief ones were the Marburg school, founded by Hermann Cohen and Ernst Cassirer, and the Heidelberg school, led by Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert.</p>
<p class="indent">The Marburg school was primarily concerned with the application of Kantian insights to the understanding of the physical sciences, and the Heidelberg school with the application of Kant to the historical and cultural sciences. Closely connected with the latter group was the social philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey. Kant influenced English thought through the philosophy of Sir William Hamilton and T. H. Green, and some Kantian ideas are found in the pragmatism of William James and John Dewey. In theology, Kant’s influence can be seen in the writings of Friedrich Schleiermacher and Albrecht Ritschl; his ideas in biology were developed by Hans Driesch and in Gestalt psychology by Wolfgang Köhler. All of Kant’s important works have been translated into English.</p>
<h3 class="h3a">Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712&ndash;78)</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is his Role in Enlightenment?</b></i></span> Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a French philosopher, and a leading figure of the Enlightenment. He believed that people are naturally good but are corrupted by society’s false values. He was against the limitations of civilised society, and advised a return to nature. He also developed the idea of the general will, and argued that conformity with it had to be the guiding principle of government. Essentially concerned with the notion of freedom, Rousseau began his masterpiece, <i class="calibre8">The Social Contract</i> (1762) with the words ‘man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains’. He argued that people sacrifice their rights in return for protection by a head of state.</p>
<p class="indent">Rousseau challenged the idea of absolute monarchy, and the tradition that the nobility and clergy were entitled to special privileges. He also had the opinion that education should be available to everyone. Rousseau’s ideas were an important influence on Romanticism and French Revolution. His writings began to influence political events, and inspired revolutions in France and North America. Slavery had no place in these nations formed to protect human rights.</p>
<p class="indent">Rousseau’s ideas also inspired people to fight for freedom on behalf of others who were unable to help themselves. Politicians, Church leaders and ordinary people began to think how they might help slaves.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did he live and Write?</b></i></span> Rousseau was born at Geneva, the son of a watchmaker. His mother died shortly after his birth, and his upbringing was haphazard. At 16, he set out on a wandering, irregular life that brought him into contact (1728) with Louise <i class="calibre8">de</i> Warens, who became his patron and later his lover. She arranged for his trip to Turin, where he became an unenthusiastic Roman Catholic convert. After serving as a footman in a powerful family, he left Turin and spent most of the next dozen years at Chambery, Savoy, with his patron. In 1742, he went to Paris to make his fortune with a new system of musical notation, but the venture failed. Once in Paris, however, he became an intimate of the circle of Denis Diderot (to whose <i class="calibre8">Encyclopedie</i> Rousseau contributed music articles), Melchior Grimm, and Mme d’Épinay. At this time also began his liaison with Therese <i class="calibre8">Le</i> Vasseur, a semi-literate servant who became his common-law wife.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1749, Rousseau won first prize in a contest, held by the Academy of Dijon, on the question: Has the progress of the sciences and arts contributed to the corruption or to the improvement of human conduct? Rousseau took the negative stand, contending that humanity was good by nature and had been fully corrupted by civilisation. His essay made him both famous and controversial. Although it is still widely believed that all of Rousseau’s philosophy was based on his call for a return to nature, this view is an oversimplification, caused by the excessive importance attached to this first essay. A second philosophical essay, <i class="calibre8">Discours sur l’origine de l’inégalité des hommes</i> (1754), is one of Rousseau’s most mature and daring productions. After its publication, Rousseau returned to Geneva, reverted to Protestantism in order to regain his citizenship, and returned to Paris with the title citizen of Geneva.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00001.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Rousseau</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-157" class="calibre10"></a>Mme d’Epinay lent him a cottage, the Hermitage, on her estate at Montmorency. Rousseau began to quarrel with Mme d’Epinay, Diderot, and Grimm, all of whom he accused of complicity in a sordid plot against him, and left the Hermitage to become the guest of the tolerant Duke <i class="calibre8">de</i> Luxembourg, whose chateau was also at Montmorency. There he finished his novel, <i class="calibre8">Julie, ou La Nouvelle Heloise</i> (1761), written in part under the influence of his love for Mme d’Houdetot, the sister-in-law of Mme d’Epinay; his <i class="calibre8">Lettre a d’Alembert sur les spectacles</i> (1758), a di-atribe against the suggestion that Geneva would be better off for having a theater; his <i class="calibre8">Du contrat social</i> (1762); and his <i class="calibre8">Emile</i> (1762), which offended both the French and Genevan ecclesiastic authorities and was burned at Paris and at Geneva.</p>
<p class="indent">Rousseau, with the connivance of highly placed friends, escaped, however, to the Swiss canton of Neuchatel, then a Prussian possession. His house was stoned, and Rousseau fled once more, this time to the canton of Bern, settling on the small island of Saint-Pierre, in the Lake of Biel. In 1765, he was expelled from Bern and accepted the invitation of David Hume to live at his house in England. There he began to write the first part of his <i class="calibre8">Confessions,</i> but after a year, he quarrelled violently with Hume, whom he believed to be in league with Diderot and Grimm, and returned to France (1767). His suspicion of people deepened and became a persecution mania.</p>
<p class="indent">After wandering through the provinces, he finally settled (1770) at Paris, where he lived in a garret and copied music. The French authorities left him undisturbed, while curious foreigners flocked to see the famous man and be insulted by him. At the same time, he went from salon to salon, reading his <i class="calibre8">Confessions</i> aloud. In his last years he began <i class="calibre8">Rêveries du promeneur solitaire,</i> descriptions of nature and his feelings about it, which was unfinished at the time of his death. Shortly before his death, Rousseau moved to the house of a protector at Ermenonville, near Paris, where he died. In 1794, his remains were transferred to the Pantheon in Paris.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is His Contribution to Philosophy?</b></i></span> Few people have equalled Rousseau’s influence in politics, literature, and education. His political thought is contained in <i class="calibre8">Du contrat social,</i> but it must be supplemented by other works, notably the <i class="calibre8">Discours sur l’origine de l’inegalite</i> and his drafts of constitutions for Corsica and for Poland. Rousseau is fundamentally a moralist rather than a metaphysician. As a moralist, he is also, unavoidably, a political theorist. His thought begins with the assumption that we are by nature good, and with the observation that in society we are not good. The fall of humanity was, for Rousseau, a social occurrence. Human nature does not go backward, and we never return to the times of innocence and equality, when we have once departed from them.</p>
<p class="indent">Although he locates the cause of our deformity in society, Rousseau was not a primitivist. In <i class="calibre8">Emile</i> and <i class="calibre8">Du contrat social,</i> he proposed, on an individual and a social level, what might be done. What was new and important about his educational philosophy, as outlined in <i class="calibre8">Emile,</i> was its rejection of the traditional ideal: education was not seen to be <a id="calibre_link-158" class="calibre10"></a>the imparting of all things to be known to the uncouth child; rather it was seen as the drawing out of what is already there, the fostering of what is native. Rousseau’s educational proposal is highly artificial, the process is carefully timed and controlled, but with the end of allowing the free development of human potential.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, with regard to the social order, Rousseau’s aim is freedom, which again does not involve a retreat to primitivism but perfect submission of the individual to what he termed the general will. The general will is what rational people would choose for the common good. Freedom, then, is obedience to a self-imposed law of reason, self-imposed because imposed by the natural laws of humanity’s being. The purpose of civil law and government, of whatever form, is to bring about a coincidence of the general will and the wishes of the people. Society gives government its sovereignty when it forms the social contract to achieve liberty and well-being as a group. While this sovereignty may be delegated in various ways (as in a monarchy, a republic, or a democracy) it cannot be transferred and resides ultimately with society as a whole, with the people, who can withdraw it when necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">Rousseau’s political philosophy assumes that there is a common good, and that the general will is not merely an ideal, but can, under the right conditions, be actual. It is under such conditions, with the rule of the general will, that Rousseau sees our full development taking place, when the advantages of a state of nature would be combined with the advantages of social life. He had such faith in the existence of the common good and the rightness of the general will, that Rousseau was extreme in the sanctions he was willing to allow for its achievement. If anyone, after publicly recognising these dogmas, behaves as if he does not believe them, let him be punished by death: He has committed the worst of all crimes, that of lying before the law. Finally, Rousseau advocated a civil religion. Rousseau’s thought sometimes rings of Calvinist Geneva, even though he reacted against its vision of humanity and had his books burned by its ecclesiastic authorities.</p>
<p class="indent">In its time, his epistolary novel <i class="calibre8">Heloise</i> was immensely popular, but it is scarcely read today, while <i class="calibre8">Confessions</i> remains widely read. Proposing to describe not only his life, but also his innermost thoughts and feelings, hiding nothing, be it ever so shameful, Rousseau followed the model of St. Augustine’s <i class="calibre8">Confession,</i> but he created a new, intensely personal style of autobiography. <i class="calibre8">The Heloise, Emile,</i> The <i class="calibre8">Confessions,</i> and The <i class="calibre8">Reveries,</i> all transfer to the domain of literature that Rousseau longed for closeness with nature.</p>
<p class="indent">His sensitive awareness apprehended the subtle influences of landscape, trees, water, birds, and other aspects of nature on the shifting state of the human soul. Rousseau was the father of Romantic sensibility; the trend existed before him, but he was the first to give it full expression. Rousseau’s style, in all his writings, is always personal, sometimes bizarre, rhetorical, bitterly sarcastic, sometimes deliberately plebeian, and often animated by a tender and musical quality unequalled in French prose. Although self-taught, he possessed a thorough knowledge of musical theory, but his compositions exerted no direct influence on music.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is his Impact?</b></i></span> Rousseau’s influence on posterity has been equalled by only a few, and it is by no means spent. His influence on German and English Romanticism&mdash;and thus, indirectly, on Romanticism in general&mdash;is difficult to overestimate. In addition, men as diverse as Immanuel Kant, Johann Goethe, Maximilien <i class="calibre8">de</i> Robespierre, Johann Pestalozzi, and Leo Tolstoy have been his disciples. His doctrine of popular sovereignty had a profound impact on French revolutionary thought. Although he did not advocate collective ownership, his ideas had their effect on socialist thought.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-20"><a id="calibre_link-159" class="calibre10"></a>RISE OF SOCIALIST IDEAS AND SPREAD OF MARXIAN SOCIALISM</h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a">General Survey</h3>
<p class="noindent">A new type of reform called socialism gained strength during the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Socialists believed that the government, led and controlled by the people, should own and operate industry, transportation and services. The government would supply goods and services to citizens at prices based on the actual amount of labour used to produce them. Socialists argued that the people, whose labour made production possible, should share in industries’ profits. This differed from capitalism, the economic system in which individuals and corporations owned and operated industries and charged prices for goods and services based on the demand for goods and highest possible profits.</p>
<p class="indent">Early socialists were called ‘Utopians’ after the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century novel in which Thomas More described a perfect community. Robert Owen, a rich English cotton manufacturer, built an ‘Utopian’ community at New Lanark, Scotland, in the early 1800s. He provided his workers with reduced working hours, high pay comfortable homes and schools for their children. In 1825, Owen built an agricultural industrial model community at New Harmony, Indiana. Both experiments later failed because of internal disagreements. During the 1840, American followers of French socialist Charles Fourier established Brook Farm in Massachusetts which was also unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="indent">It remained for Karl Marx, German philosopher and economist, to find modern socialism. Exiled from Prussia as a result of his political writings, Marx moved to London. In 1848, he and another German, Frederick Engel, published the ‘<i class="calibre8">Communist Manifesto</i>’. Feeling that the utopian socialists were too idealistic, they called their theory ‘scientific socialism’. Marx later wrote ‘<i class="calibre8">Das Kapital</i>’ which criticised capitalism by arguing that the working class should control a nation’s economy and social conditions. Marx considered control of an economy to be a crucial issue of history. He reasoned that only those people who made things society used should decide what they and their goods were worth. Under capitalism, Marx said, only a minority of the people, those who owned the means of production decided the worth of goods while the rest of the people, the workers, did not.</p>
<p class="indent">Socialist parties met at London in 1864 and 1889 to form the International Workingmen’s Association, or the International. They urged workers throughout the world to unite. Since then, socialist parties in countries all over the world have had significant political influence.</p>
<h3 class="h3a">Socialist Ideas</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Socialism?</b></i></span> Bourgeois or middle class rule superseded the domination of the absolute monarchies and aristocracy of the old regime. When the new governments were set up, legislation restricting business enterprises was revoked and almost nothing was done to better the conditions of the workers. Socialism was, therefore, the proletariat’s (workers) answer to the restrictions imposed upon them by the bourgeois rule. The socialist idea of political organisation took diverse forms, ranging from legislative, evolutionary reform without disturbing the political structure of the state to a violent, revolutionary overthrow of existing governments and the establishment of a political order controlled by the workers.</p>
<p class="indent">The origin of socialism can be dated back to the French Revolution when assortment of ideas for the reconstruction of the society were mooted. Baneuf made extensive use of his own newspapers and several popular songs that he sponsored in order to popularise his ideas. Charged with causing an uprising, he was arrested and executed in 1797.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Originate and Grow?</b></i></span> Some Idealists including Saint Simon, Owen and Fourier, came out with what has been called ‘Utopian <a id="calibre_link-160" class="calibre10"></a>Socialism’ named after Sir Thomas More’s <i class="calibre8">Utopia</i>. They favoured voluntary formation of social groups into large groups Tandy like organisations, so that the unit could live together. Saint Simon (1760&ndash;1825), a Frenchman who participated in the American Revolution, spent a huge amount on an unsuccessful social experiment. He advocated common ownership of all land and capital to be managed scientifically by the state. His slogan was ‘From each according to his capacity and to each according to his need. Robert Owen (1771&ndash;1858), a rich Englishman, made futile experiments at New Lanark in Scotland and at New Harmony in Indiana (USA). Charles Fourier (1772&ndash;1827), another Frenchman, held that people should be divided into industrial communities. The earning should be divided after each citizen was given a starting sum giving labour five parts, capital four and talent three parts of remainder. A number of attempts were made to carry out his plan, the best among them being the Brook Farm in Massachusetts (USA) by his American followers. These Utopian Socialists had only a small following even among the working class. Their ideas were too theoretical and idealistic to be carried out but they did attract the attention of reformers to the need for change and thus indirectly achieved their aim. Yet, till 1850, the Socialist Movement did not make much headway in Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">Karl Marx (1818&ndash;1888), the profounder of Scientific Socialism or Marxian Socialism, not only gave a theory and but also gave a graphic sketch of the kind of society that he desired. He provided the working men’s organisation with a social philosophy and a program for social reform. The ‘<i class="calibre8">Communist Manifesto</i>’, one of the most vital document of Socialism, was written by him and his co-worker, Frederick Engel (1820&ndash;1895) during the Paris Revolution of 1848. In this, they made an impassioned appeal to the workers of Europe to unite and throw off their chains.</p>
<p class="indent">‘<i class="calibre8">Das Kapital</i>’ a much more detailed and scholarly work on the socialist theory was also their combined effort. Modern scientific socialism is built around these two works. The two basic principles involved are the theory of value and the materialistic conception of history. The influence of Marx would be difficult to overestimate. The Russian Communist state was the first ever successful experiment of his theories and since its inception, has been a great influence on the proletariat.</p>
<p class="indent">Marxian Socialist which was distinctly revolutionary in nature preached the inevitability of class war. But all socialists did not share its views. An influential group in England, for instance, sponsored what is called ‘Evolutionary Socialism’. It was the Fabian Society, organised in 1884 that aimed at ‘The reorganisation of society by the emancipation of land and industrial capital from individual and class ownership and vesting them in the community for the common benefit’. Its members came from diverse fields and include journalists, artists, literary men and women, social workers and teachers. They adopted their name from the Roman general, Quintus Fabius, famous for his delaying tactics. Publication of pamphlets was their chief method of propagation of their ideas. The Fabians, unlike Marx did not condemn capital as being stolen funds of labour; instead they admited that the capitalist has his role, to play in society. In their opinion, capitalists deserved a reward for the organisation of industry, but ultimately they should be replaced by paid employers. The Fabians contended that there were many values created wholly by the community which should be used not for private profit but for the benefit of the whole community. The means of production, for example, should be utilised for the general welfare, instead of being exploited for the enrichment of the few.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet another variety of social control that arose in Europe was ‘Syndicalism’. It is based on trade union organisation which is held to <a id="calibre_link-161" class="calibre10"></a>be the foundation of the new society and the means through which it can be brought about. It agrees with the Marxian theory of an inevitable clash between capital and labour, and aims at the abolition of private ownership of the means of production. Believing in the producer’s control, it gives workers charge of the economic and political affairs of the state. Syndicalism claims to be more of the product of the workers than any other form of socialism and hence, much more in conformity with their needs. Its efficiency is also stressed. If workers own and control the industry in which they work, they will have a greater personal interest in the conduct of the plant and enjoy a greater amount of freedom than that offered by the capitalistic system.</p>
<p class="indent">Guild socialism, which closely resembles syndicalism aimed at ‘the abolition of the wage system, and the establishment of selfgovernment in industry by the workers, through a democratic system of national guilds, working in conjunction with other democratic functional organisations in the community’. Power and responsibility in society were to be in proportion to the importance of the work that the individuals perform. Guild socialists held that industry should be supervised by technocrats rather than unskilled workmen. Besides, the interests of the consumer should be taken into consideration. This was sought to be guaranteed through consumer’s councils, which acting in cooperation with producer’s guilds, would fix prices and control the distribution of goods.</p>
<p class="indent">The most radical among the socialist ideologies, however, is Anarchism. Initially the Anarchists were part of the Communists, but they were expelled in 1869 at the Fourth Congress of the First International. Under the leadership of Bakunin (1814&ndash;1876) and Kropotkin (1842&ndash;1921), a separate organisation came into being. They propagated the overthrow of existing governments and favoured a system under which society is conceived without government, and harmony in such a society being obtained not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between various groups. The Anarchists were, however not sure about the manner in which such a society could be established and maintained. Yet they were quite definite in their criticism of the existing form of government.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Significance?</b></i></span> Majority of the people no longer considered political democracy as the last word in government. In fact, there were quite a few who contended that democracy had failed. The growing power and influence of the proletariat had resulted in increased toleration of socialism. Democracy had even been condemned as an agency of <a id="calibre_link-162" class="calibre10"></a>the bourgeoisie for the suppression of the proletariat.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00029.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Karl Marx</p>
<p class="indent">Socialist theories, despite their growing popularity, suffered from certain limitations. All forms of socialism were based on the presumption that men are willing to work for the general good of society and not for their own benefit, which was quite doubtful. For the incentive to do better financially than one’s neighbour was one of the primary motivations for men. Besides, ‘to consume without producing’ was considered, by the socialists, as an act subject to punishment. How well it can be enforced remains to be seen. Moreover, the question of administration of the socialist state was a serious problem. Most socialists believed in the necessity of a fundamental change in existing political system. Chaos followed in almost every socialist experiment. Centralisation of authority destroys the socialist aim. Something must be found as a substitute for the State. Some central authority to regulate economic and social activities in a harmonious group seems indispensable. Revolutionary socialists, by far the most dynamic group, insist upon the complete destruction of many important contributions that we own to capitalism. The risk of a revolution is great and the ruling class that emerges from it may not be what the idealist prefers. However, these dangers are not insurmountable obstacles.</p>
<h3 class="h3a">Labour Movement in Europe</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What Led to the Rise of the Labour Movement?</b></i></span> From the dawn of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the European states tried to regulate labour for protecting workmen from unscrupulous employers. Though improvements in the working conditions were effected in most classes, factory legislation did not go far enough to satisfy the labour groups. Labourers eventually realised after great suffering that by forming combinations and working together, they could make their demands much more effective.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, Such attempts were fraught with several difficulties. The best type of organisation was the way to appeal to fellow workers, dissension in their own ranks, difficulty of agreement on aims, and the best manner of confronting employers were questions that threw up many plans and a variety of opinions.</p>
<p class="indent">However, leaders were agreed on two things; first, replacement of individual bargaining (between workmen and employer) with collective bargaining for the purpose of obtaining a standard wage and standard working hours and secondly, a united front on the part of labour to prevent one person from underselling labour in general. The aim was to use peaceful negotiations but if that method failed, a strike might be used as a last resort. The labour movement in Europe developed on three lines, viz. unionism, cooperation and politics.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Origin?</b></i></span> The roots of modern trade union can probably be traced to the journeyman’s associations or guilds in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The journeyman did not press for his demands fully because of the relative certainty that he would become master craftsman and thus be relieved of the abuses about which he complained. There was no permanency in the status of the worker and he lived in hopes of rising above the position of a mere workmen.</p>
<p class="indent">The industrial revolution completely changed the position of the ordinary worker. The establishment of a factory system drew the employee and the employer further and further apart. The factory, at the same time, brought together in one group a large number of labourers, all of whom had common interests. They were naturally opposed to the interests of the employer which made them to fight untidily to promote their own interests.</p>
<p class="indent">Progress in labour organisation was tardy due to several obstacles, like the ignorance and inexperience of labourers, prohibitive laws, hostile public opinion, etc. In England, <a id="calibre_link-163" class="calibre10"></a>for instance, the combination Acts of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century prevented artisans or tradesmen, either employers or employees, from combining for the purpose of changing rates of wages. The enforcement of the law generally favoured the employer. In fact, there was on the part of the upper class a prevailing fear of democratic movements on the part of the masses. The clergy, philanthropists, and economists were suspicious of the motives and policies of labour organisations.</p>
<p class="indent">The movement towards trade unionism faced what appeared to be insurmountable obstacles in the incompetency of labour leaders in the influence of the employers in official circles in the existence of prohibitory laws, and in the hostility of public opinion. However, one by one, these obstacles have been overcome.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How and where did it Grow Between 1800 and 1914?</b></i></span> The law prohibiting labour combinations were not in agreement with the spirit of liberalism, which had made great progress in England in the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The general abolition of various restrictions in conformity with the philosophic tendency included even the repeal of the Combination Act (1825). Parliament, however, was not willing to permit violence and intimidation on the part of both employer and employee. Collective bargaining was given legal recognition. Some more obstacles were removed in 1871 and in 1875, and this gave trade union in England legal rights similar to those of any other organisation. Consequently, there was the gradual disappearance of public suspicion and animosity against trade unions.</p>
<p class="indent">Trade unions made rapid progress after their legalisation. Funds were created through dues in order to promote their cause and to aid members who were forced out to work because of illness. Workers in different occupations were organised into trade unions, and annual trade unions, congresses were started in 1864. Regular yearly meetings have been held since 1869. English labourers began to send delegates to London while parliament was in session in order to obtain favourable legislation and the appointment of officials in the interest of trade unions. On the whole, they have been very successful. Later, the English experience was used to good effect by the workers in Germany, France Italy and the U.S.A.</p>
<p class="indent">The English trade unions even found a means of expression in politics. Members were used to vote for certain candidates in 1893 a separate party called the Labour party come into being, though they could elect a member to parliament only in 1900. In 1906, seven labour candidates were sent to the represent working class in the government. Two famous cases&mdash;the Taff Vale case (1901) and the Osborne judgement (1909)&mdash;accentuated political activity on the part of the labourites. The Taff Vale decision pronounced that trade unions might be sued and if convicted, be forced to pay damages for losses incurred to a company’s property through strikes. In 1906, the parliament was persuaded to pass the Trade Disputes Act which practically reversed the above decision. The Osborne judgement held it illegal for trade union to bear the cost of expenses of members in parliament. As members of parliament received no remuneration at that time it was very hard for a representative of the workers to serve because of lack of funds. So in 1911, at the behest of the Labour Party, a bill for the payment of salaries to all members of the House of Commons was passed. The Labour party became strong enough during the First World War to be a Party to the coalition government.</p>
<p class="indent">German labour organisations date back to the Franco Prussian War. Labour leaders faced a hostile government. Anti-socialist laws were in force in Germany until 1890 but by 1914 labour was well organised. German employers resisted labour groups by organising to oppose them. The Central Union of German Industrialists made up of the colliery proprietors and iron <a id="calibre_link-164" class="calibre10"></a>masters of Westphalia is an example. They attempted to boycott the unions by refusing to give employment to trade unionists and socialists. The struggle was still going on when World War I broke out in 1914.</p>
<p class="indent">In France, labour organisation was slower and more irregular than in England or Germany. Labour combinations were forbidden by Napoleon; the problem was discussed at great length in the famous penal code of 1810. There was no marked relaxation until after the Revolution of 1830. At the time the progress of Saint Simon and Fourier began to attract attention. But napoleon III revived the labour legislation of his uncle the great Napoleon in 1851 and it was not until 1864 that combinations of workmen were legalised. The famous Waldeck Rousseau Law in 1884 gave labour recognition in France that it had gained in Germany and England.</p>
<p class="indent">The ‘Confederation General Du Travail’ or the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), one of the largest and most influential labour organisations in the world, was organised at Limoges in 1895. It excluded politics and declared that its sole object was unification of workers. The society was active in the propagation of revolutionary ideas to the workmen so effectively that in 1906, there were innumerable strikes.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How and where did it Grow Between the World Wars?</b></i></span> Labour movements survived the First World War in all the parliamentary democracies of Europe. In Britain, workmen had the hardest time, for technology destroyed jobs and unemployment became chronic. Simultaneously, the Labour Party, under the influence of its socialist wing, increased its vote enough to form a government (with liberal help) in 1923 and 1929. Even with the aid of strikes, neither the trade unions nor the party was able to solve the problems of the economy.</p>
<p class="indent">In France, the labour movement was no more successful. The old membership of the CGT was replaced by new element, mostly unskilled, with a wide variety of socialist persuasions. In late 1918, the CGT announced a new programme revealing a willingness to accept the government as a partner with a demand for rationalisation of key industries. In 1920, the French socialists, sympathetic to communist influences, precipitated a general strike. The event proved so great a fiasco that the CGT expelled its Communist members who established their own confederation.</p>
<p class="indent">The German workers recovered quickly from the war. They rejuvenated their old organisations, assumed a place of importance within the government of Weimar republic and persuaded employers to concede some more demands. Throughout the 1920s, German trade unions operated cautiously to preserve liberal democracy and to promote their social gains. They hunted out and expelled trouble making communists. However, the world wide Depression brought drastic changes. The declining economy produced an ideological political war in Germany that reached fruition in 1933 with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in control.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Hitler’s Impact on it?</b></i></span> In Britain, where workers focussed on rising unemployment and agitated for nationalisation of mines and railways, a shift occurred in public attitudes. For the first time, non-industrial elements among the British people revealed sympathy for labour’s plight. The shift encouraged a growth of membership in the Trade Union Congress. Workmen benefitted through collective bargaining and a new atmosphere of mutual responsibility was created.</p>
<p class="indent">In France, dissatisfaction with parliamentary democracy grew rapidly. Farm prices and middle class incomes had declined. Reduction in government payrolls and tax receipts were blamed on the government which seemed singularly inept compared to the efficient totalitarian governments of Mussolini and <a id="calibre_link-165" class="calibre10"></a>Hitler. After a clash between native fascists and communists, the CGT and the socialists called a general strike (1934) which was the first successful general strike in French history. In 1936, the Socialist and Communist parties merged with the Radical socialists to elect a popular Front government headed by Leon Blum. These events released a reservoir of suppressed hope among French workers and strikes followed. Blum managed to persuade employers to accept the inevitable, parliament legalised the right to organise and to bargain collectively along with establishing a 40-hour week. Membership of the trade unions mushroomed to unprecedented levels.</p>
<p class="indent">In Germany, however, Hitler had destroyed the German trade union movement with one stroke of his pen in 1933. The end of the Second World War (1945) however, quickly revived trade union movements which moved almost in concert throughout West European countries towards three objectives, <i class="calibre8">viz.</i> (a) enlargement of power, (b) more government control of the economy, and (c) expansion of welfare programmes.</p>
<p class="indent">The Labour Party in Britain won a parliamentary majority. The French CGT claimed five million members, while a coalition of communists, socialists and moderates took over control of the provisional government and created a new constitution (Fourth Republic) with the traditional aims of labour guaranteed. In both Britain and France, labour-influenced governments nationalised a party of industry.</p>

<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Absolute Monarchies</b></h3>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">General Survey</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent">The dawn of modern period in Europe also witnessed the emergence of the new absolute monarchs who were building cohesive political structures. The roots of this consolidation process go back to the death of Charlemagne in 814, when Europe entered a period of disintegration and political anarchy. In broad terms, the political evolution of Western Europe after Charlemagne may be divided into three stages. Between 9<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 11<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, Popes and emperors generally cooperated. Popes helped the emperors against the German secular lords and in return were supported against the Byzantine opponents to papal authority. In 1073, with the accession of Pope Gregory VII, began the second stage&ndash;the period of papal supremacy. The investiture dispute between the papacy and the emperors (i.e., the struggle to control the selection of German bishops) was won by Gregory. So, imperial administration and power were undermined. For over two centuries, the papacy was generally recognised as the head of Latin Christendom, particularly because there was a succession of pious French and English kings in the mid-13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The period of papal supremacy ended in 1296 on the issue of taxation of clergy. In that year, the Pope issued a bull asserting that the laity had no authority over the clergy and threatening to <a id="calibre_link-169" class="calibre10"></a>excommunicate anyone who attempted to tax the clergy. Philip rejected Pope’s claims and was able to enforce his policies with complete success. He even forced the transfer of the papal seat from Rome to Avignon, and from then on the papacy collaborated openly with the French monarchy.</p>
<p class="indent">By the end of the 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, this trend away from the universal Church and towards the new absolute monarchies was apparent in the powerful political structures presided over by several rulers in Europe. One reason for the success of these rulers was the revolution in military technology that came with the advent of artillery. Feudal lords no longer could defy royal authority from behind their castle walls. Only absolute monarchs possessed the financial resources and administrative organisation necessary to purchase the guns, powder, and the shot and to provide required logistical support.</p>
<p class="indent">Another source of power for the new monarchs was their informal alliance with the growing merchant class. From this class, the kings obtained essential financial support and also competent and subservient officials to staff the growing state bureaucracies. In return, the consolidation of royal power aided the burghers by ending the incessant feudal wars and doing away with the crazy pattern of local feudal authorities in which each had its own customs, laws, weights, and currencies.</p>
<p class="indent">The new monarchs naturally had their own defenders and rationalisers, as do all political establishments. The best known of these was Niccola Machiavelli (1459&ndash;1527), a product of the ruthless struggle for survival amongst the competing city-states of Renaissance Italy. Machiavelli viewed politics as a struggle for power in which the end justifies the means. In his book, <i class="calibre8">The Prince</i>, he set forth guidelines for the rulers who aspired to unite the fragmented Italian peninsula and to get it rid of the French and Spanish invaders. With cool and relentless realism, he rejected moral restraints and spelled out the difference between politics and religion or philosophy.</p>
<p class="indent">The new monarchs pursuing strategies based on the precepts of <i class="calibre8">The Prince</i> were bound to clash with the two universal institutions of Europe, the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. The conflict was sharpened by the sensational rise of the Spanish dynasty through marriage ties. Ferdinand and Isabella married their daughter Joanna to Philip of Hapsburg. Charles, the offspring of this union, inherited the united Spanish kingdom together with the Spanish possessions in the New World and in Italy (Sardinia, Sicily and Naples). He also held the hereditary Hapsburg lands in Europe in spite of the opposition of French and English monarchs. Thus Charles V, at the age of 19, became the ruler of a larger territory than had been collected under one monarch since the break-up of Charlemagne’s empire seven centuries earlier.</p>
<p class="indent">For a time it appeared that Western Europe would be united once more in a vast international organisation. Other European dynasties, and especially the Valois of France, were determined to prevent Hapsburg hegemony. The result was the long series of wars, partly religious, and partly dynastic. This prolonged violence was followed by the even more disastrous Thirty Years War. Although this war was precipitated by the question of the succession to the Bohemian throne, it soon became essentially a struggle between the Bourbon and Hapsburg dynasties for control of the continent of Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">The territorial provisions of the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) did not last, but their overall significance is clear. The princes of Central Europe, backed by France, Sweden and other countries successfully resisted the centralising efforts of the Hapsburgs. The empire now was a collection of small independent states, each with the right to conduct its foreign as well as domestic affairs.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-170" class="calibre10"></a>Thus, the decline of the Empire and of the papacy, and the growth of separate nations inevitably led to the formation of strong monarchies in many of the countries of Europe. Kings aimed at making themselves absolute, and they were frequently successful. At the end of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, France was rapidly approaching a position in which the king could do practically as he liked; Spain was ruled autocratically, so were many Italian principalities; and the English monarchy had reached the zenith of its power. During the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, the rulers of France, Russia, Austria and Prussia succeeded in enhancing considerably the strength and the outward grandeur of their positions, but in England attempts to establish absolute monarchy ended in failure. There the trading and commercial classes were prepared to tolerate royal pretensions, so long as they did not seriously interfere with their own interests, but when the dignity of royalty demanded arbitrary taxation and the control of people’s consciences, they preferred rebellion to compliance with a state of affairs which struck at the very root of personal liberty. The middle classes of the continental countries also did the same ultimately, but at a much later date.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the New Absolute Monarchies?</b></i></span> European history from the beginning of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century onward is a story of people finding their way darkly to some new method of government better suited to the newly arising conditions. The search for a new method of government first took the form of new absolute monarchies. An important sign of the growing authority of kings in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries was the universal decay of the representative institutions which had come into existence in many European countries in the later Middle Ages. By 1789, most of Europe was ruled by monarchs little hindered by the existence of effective and continuing representative bodies, the main exception being Great Britain. Kings began their ascent to this position in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, when they came to enjoy almost absolute powers. This phenomenon is generally termed as the rise of absolute monarchy.</p>
<p class="indent">In many countries, the late 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century had brought a widespread wish to do away with disorder. People were ready to accept government if it would guarantee order and peace. There were special reasons in almost every case, but nearly everywhere monarchs raised themselves further above the level of the greatest nobles and buttressed their new pretensions to respect authority with cannons and taxation. The obligatory sharing of power with their great subjects, whose status entitled them <i class="calibre8">de facto</i> and sometimes <i class="calibre8">de jure</i> to office, ceased to weigh so heavily upon kings who more and more could choose their own servants.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did they Come into Being?</b></i></span> From 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century onward, the history of Europe is a story of political and social institutions becoming more and more plainly misfits, less comfortable and more vexatious, and of the slow, reluctant realisation of the need for a conscious and deliberate reconstruction of the whole scheme of human societies in the face of needs and possibilities new to all the former experiences of life. What are these changes in the conditions of human life that have disorganised the balance of empire, priest, peasant and trader that has held human affairs in the old world in a sort of working rhythm for such a long time? They were manifold and various, for human affairs are multitudinously complex.</p>
<p class="indent">The feudal lords during the Middle Ages created political anarchy all over the continent, by their bloody and continuous warfare. The people were exasperated over this sorry state of affairs, and wanted the establishment of a strong centralised government capable of maintaining peace and order and providing security of life and property. Thus, popular support was given to the monarchs in their contest against the feudal lords and the Church, <a id="calibre_link-171" class="calibre10"></a>because these kings promised a more capable form of government.</p>
<p class="indent">Geographical discoveries promoted commercial activities which in turn paved the way for the rise of the bourgeoisie. These middle classes, especially merchants, traders and industrialists provided full support to the absolute monarchs to establish stable governments which could restore peace and order, and enable them to carry on their trade peacefully. They provided rulers with human and material help to crush the feudal lords.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Middle Ages, kings had no standing armies, and each feudal lord maintained his own armed forces, rendering military service to the king whenever the need arose. This military dependence of the kings on the feudal lords made his position weak viś-a-vis the lords. But the economic transformation of Europe at the time enabled the kings to maintain standing armies. The introduction of guns and gunpowder into Europe brought about a great change in the methods of warfare. The kings claimed the monopoly of gunpowder, and began to equip their forces with firearms. With their help, kings destroyed the castles of the feudal lords, and thus gave a death blow to their military strength.</p>
<p class="indent">The decline of feudalism, the growing urbanisation and the revival of trade and commerce sowed the seeds of nationalism, while the wars of the late Middle Ages and the religious wars in the wake of the Reformation also aroused the feeling of nationalism among the Europeans. In the face of danger from a common enemy, people of a particular country forget their differences and begin to think of themselves as a nation. These wars against a common enemy enhanced the power and prestige of the monarchs who led the people in these wars, and thus made it possible for them to establish their absolute rule.</p>
<p class="indent">The Renaissance scholars and the leaders of the Reformation were generally in favour of absolute governments. The revival of classics enabled the people to realise that they would do better under a strong centralised government. The Reformation also rejected the idea of Universal Church and empire, and thus strengthened absolutism of national kings. Martin Luther, for example, emphasised the doctrine of divine right of kings, and advised people to give passive obedience to their rulers. The national Churches that were established after the Reformation were under the complete control of the state, and consequently the kings became more powerful and absolute.</p>
<p class="indent">The writings of some political philosophers and thinkers also played a crucial role in this political process. Machiavelli, for instance, favoured absolute monarchy in <i class="calibre8">The Prince</i>. A Frenchman, called Bodin (1529&ndash;1596), also stood for a strong state government in his book <i class="calibre8">The State</i>. The sovereign, he opined, should be the source of all law, and is responsible only to God. Hobbes (1588&ndash;1679), an English-man, too supported absolutism. But his concept of absolutism is different from that of Machiavelli in one important respect, i.e., the former is based on the consent of the people or governed while the latter is not.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00108.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Hobbes</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the contemporary rulers, such as Louis XIV of France, Frederick II of Prussia, Peter the Great and Catherine II of Russia, Joseph II of Austria, and Charles III of Spain were capable and popular which gave a boost to the institution of absolute monarchy. They were benevolent despots and well acquainted <a id="calibre_link-172" class="calibre10"></a>with the philosophy of Enlightenment. They implemented various reforms, and improved the economic conditions of the people. Apart from promoting agriculture, trade and industry, they also patronised education, art and literature.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How and where did they Arise?</b></i></span> The history of nearly all Europe during the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>, 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries was, as mentioned earlier, the story of an attempt to strengthen monarchy, to make it absolute, and to extend its power over weaker adjacent regions and of steady resistance, first of the feudal lords and then, with the increase of foreign trade and home industry, of the growing trading and moneyed classes to the exactions and interference of the crown.</p>
<p class="indent">Spain was the first to achieve importance under an absolute government. Spanish nationalism benefitted from the long drawn struggle with the Muslims, and from the newly acquired colonial possessions in Americas. The early Hapsburg rulers entered into matrimonial alliances with the most powerful families of Europe. Joanna, the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, was married to the heir of the Austrian throne; and Charles V, the offspring of this union, fell heir to the vast domains of both Spain and Austria. Besides, he was made the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. But Philip II got entangled in detrimental war with England, during which his famous Armada was destroyed (1588) and the rapid decline of Spain began. In spite of the vast colonial resources, the treasury was emptied, because the Spanish monarchs not only involved themselves in almost ceaseless warfare with foreign powers but also faced numerous rebellions at home. Moreover, the rulers antagonised the commercial and industrial class, which not only weakened the monarchy but also hampered economic progress within the country. Thus, the Spanish monarchs diminished the power of the very class that could have been theirs naturally.</p>
<p class="indent">In France, the new absolute monarchy was the most successful. The French kings not only reached a position of almost unbridled power and grandeur, but furnished an example which inspired the kings of other European countries. Although the landowning and the merchant classes frequently found their interests threatened by the pretensions of royalty, they were not able to resist them so effectively as the landowners and merchants of England. The French Estates General had nothing approaching the influence of the English parliament. Its meetings were irregular; kings had occasionally summoned it when they needed money, but merely in order that its approbation of new taxes might make their collection easier. They never admitted that they had not the right, if they chose to exercise it, to levy taxes without consulting their subjects at all. When the Estates-General met in 1789, the first year of the great revolution, it was actually assembling for the first time since 1614. Thus opposition to royal demands could not be effectively made in the Estates-General. Those who thought that the power of the king should be curbed had to fall back upon the device of forming leagues against him, which generally lacked unity and constructive purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">The most famous of these leagues was the Fronde, which was contemporary with the later stages of the English Civil War, to which it bears some resemblances. They were protests against absolute monarchy, and just as Charles I had to pay the reckoning for the deeds of his father James I, so Cardinal Mazarin, who ruled France (Louis XIV, the king, was a minor) when the Wars of the Fronde were waged, had to pay for carrying on the policy of his great master and predecessor, Cardinal Richelieu&mdash;the policy of building up a strong and ruthless absolutism, which would make the king (or his chief minister) the undisputed master of France. But the English Rebellion was successful: the Fronde was not, and one of the chief causes of <a id="calibre_link-173" class="calibre10"></a>its failure was the lack of seriousness among many of those who took part in it, and the selfish ambitions of others. The Frondeurs, unlike the parliamentarians of England, did not have religion to animate them and encourage them to overthrow the edifice of irresponsible government. In 1652, they were conclusively beaten, and after that date the king and his courtiers dominated French life. From this time until the Revolution of 1789, the government of France was as autocratic as it could be. Taxes were imposed in the most arbitrary manner, and in such a way that they fell principally upon the poorer classes, who were least able to pay them; wars were made in order to gratify personal ambitions and increase the grandeur of royalty; and the king definitely took up the attitude that he held his authority directly from God, and that he was answerable to no one.</p>
<p class="indent">Absolute monarchy reached its climax under Louis XIV, ‘The Sun King’ (1643&ndash;1715). Louis was an exceptionally ambitious man. He wished to extend the boundaries of France to the Rhine and the Pyrenees, and to absorb the Spanish Netherlands. In the former of these objects, he partially succeeded: in the latter he was thwarted by the opposition of England and Holland. It was not only by wars of aggression that Louis XIV spent the hard-earned money of the French people. Splendour was almost a craze with him: his court became proverbial for its lavish display of wealth, and his palace at Versailles, became the envy and admiration of the world. His patronage of art and literary men was part of the same policy, but a more excellent part. Louis XIV was succeeded by his great-grandson, Louis XV, during whose reign, money was spent lavishly on wars and worthless mistresses who ministered to the king’s pleasures, and France was plunged deeper and deeper into the morass of bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="indent">Outside France, absolute monarchy was most successful in Prussia and Russia. Prussia was ruled by the Hohenzollern dynasty, which was not overthrown until 1918. Its rise, from the comparatively small duchy of Brandenburg to a kingdom which eventually covered nearly two thirds of Germany, is one of the most striking features of modern history. The first of its rulers to give indication that formidable power was arising was the Elector Frederick William, known as the Great Elector (1640&ndash;1688), who succeeded in creating an absolute monarchy.</p>
<p class="indent">His son, Frederick I was the first to take the title of King of Prussia. His grandson King Frederick William I, a rough and boorish king, increased his army from 27,000 to 84,000 men, and by careful management and miserly economy left a well-filled treasury as well for his son and successor, Frederick II, who is generally called Frederick, the Great. Under him the Prussian kingdom made marvellous progress, despite two long and exhausting wars. It was considerably enlarged by the acquisition of Austrian Silesia and part of Poland; its population was trebled; its army, 200,000 strong, was the most efficient in the world; and Frederick could have declared, with perfect truth, that the state was himself. In some respects, he aped Louis XIV. He built a great palace at Potsdam which copied the glories of Versailles. He patronised literary men, and entertained Voltaire, an experiment which was not a success.</p>
<p class="indent">Russia, until accession of Peter the Great in 1689, was an Asiatic state with no seaport, no ships, and an army which it would have been almost ludicrous to compare with the well-disciplined troops of Western Europe. Peter spared no effort to make his country into a European power. He visited Germany, Holland, and England so as to investigate the arts and sciences of the West; he brought back with him skilled artisans, architects, ships’ captains, and scientific men to aid in the development of Russia; he forced his subjects to abandon their oriental habits, such as their custom of growing long beards: he remodelled the government <a id="calibre_link-174" class="calibre10"></a>according to western ideas: he built a navy and made the army more efficient; and he conquered from Sweden lands such as Litvania and Estonia, which lay between Russia and the Baltic Sea. Not content with the old capital, Moscow, which clung somewhat tenaciously to its ancient habit, he built a new capital, St. Petersburg, and like Frederick the Great of Prussia, he built in imitation of Versailles, the Peterhof. Almost the only feature of the old regime which he was content to retain was its despotic nature. The Czar must remain the absolute master of all his subjects, and there are frequent instances of Peter punishing those who dared to resist his authority with barbarity. After Peter’s death in 1725, Russia was governed by various incompetent rulers until the accession of Catherine II, a German princess, in 1762. She ascended the throne after arranging the murder of her husband the Czar, and ever since her time, Russia has been a force to be reckoned with in the affairs of Europe and the world.</p>
<p class="indent">Another family, the Hapsburgs, from their capital of Vienna had been gradually building up the Austrian Empire, the vast realm over which they ruled until 1918. From 1438 until 1806, although the old form of election was still maintained, all but one of the Emperors were Hapsburgs, and in 1806, when Napoleon brought the Holy Roman Empire to an end, they took the less pretentious but far more practical title of Emperor of Austria. When Maria Theresa succeeded her father in 1740, the Austrian dominions included Austria, Moravia, Hungary, Bohemia, Silesia, Styra, Carinthia, Tyrol, and the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium), and Milan. Silesia was soon conquered by Frederick of Prussia, but the Empress secured some compensation by the acquisition of Galician Poland. The task of ruling these extensive territories was a particularly difficult one, because of the numerous and diverse races who inhabited them. When Maria Theresa died after a reign of 40 years she was succeeded by her son Joseph II, a man of considerable enlightenment, whose great ambition was to consolidate all his dominions into one homogeneous whole, to break down the barriers of nationality, to raise the community to legal equality with their former masters, to constitute a uniform level of democratic simplicity under his own absolute sway. His intentions were, generally speaking, admirable, and if he had to deal with an enlightened or united people, they would have been welcomed. But Joseph, when he set himself the task of forming a well-organised central state, like that formed by Frederick the Great in Prussia, apparently failed to grasp the peculiar difficulties of his position. He had to carry through his policy in a state composed of the most diverse elements in Europe, only held together by the personal tie of sovereignty and the influence of the Church, which he alienated by an attack upon its privileges. National prejudices were too strong for him; he was regarded with suspicion on all hands; insurrections broke out in the Netherlands and other places, and, despite his utmost efforts, Austria remained a ramshackle empire until its final dissolution in 1918.</p>
<p class="indent">In England, Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I of the Tudor dynasty, with the help of their ministers Wolsey and Burleigh respectively, laid the foundations for absolutism, but it was destroyed by the folly of the first Stuarts, James I and Charles I. The latter was beheaded for treason to his people in 1649, marking an aberration in the political thought of Europe. For a dozen years, i.e., until 1660, Britain was a republic; and the Crown was an unsteady power, overwhelmed by Parliament, until George III (1760&ndash;1820) made a relentless but only a partly successful effort to restore its predominance.</p>

<p class="caption">Europe in 1519</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did they Decline?</b></i></span> The main defect of the absolute monarchy with its hereditary nature lay in the over dependency upon the character and personality of the monarch. Where there was a good ruler there was a good government, but a succession of good rulers could not be assured. A good number of them neglected their duties and enjoyed the splendour and luxury of the court instead of taking care of the details of government. Routine work was delegated to ruthless ministers, who fully exploited the situation to their advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">The absolute monarchs, without exception, carried on schemes of aggrandisement against each other. Each one pursued a “foreign policy” of aggression against his neighbours and of aggressive alliances. We are also told of how this war was caused by the king’s mistress, and how the jealousy of one minister for another caused that. Thus, aggrandisement and whimsical policies caused destructive wars, which in turn often resulted in economic ruin.</p>
<p class="indent">In spite of the triumph of absolutism, the idea of popular government still had an appeal. Some of the states, in fact, had representative bodies. France had ‘Estates General’, which, however, soon ceased to exert any influence, but the English Parliament got itself entrenched in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Cities in Northern Italy, in France, and in the Swiss Cantons had representative governments. The existence of the idea of <a id="calibre_link-176" class="calibre10"></a>popular government and of the representative bodies began to influence the minds of those people who were ruled by absolute monarchs particularly when these monarchs were inefficient and degenerate.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the principle of absolutism itself did not go uncontested, and in fact, it was assailed severely in some places. In the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century itself, the Netherlands rebelled against the rule of the Spanish Crown and a century later, its people (the Dutch) established a republic, with political power vested in parliament. Poland repudiated absolutism, but fell victim to the territorial ambitions of Prussia, Russia and Austria. Thus, absolutism had been challenged and gradually gained disrepute among the democratic minded people.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">The Nation-States</b></h3>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">General Survey</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent">Most people in the world today are familiar, at least in a rough and ready way, with the idea of the state. They accept that the world’s surface is divided by impersonal organisations working through officials marked out in special ways, and that such organisations provide the final public authority for any given area. Often, they might also think that the state in some way represented a nation. But whether they did so or not, states would be the building blocks from which most of us would construct a political account of the modern world.</p>
<p class="indent">Hardly any of this would have been intelligible to an European in 1000 AD. The process, by which the modern state emerged, though far from complete by 1500, is one of the markers which delimit the modern era of history. The realities had come first before principles and ideas. From the 13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century onwards, many rulers, usually kings, were able, for a variety of reasons, to increase their power over those they ruled. This was often because they could keep up large armies and arm them with the most effective weapons. Many rulers were by 1500 well on the way to exercising a monopoly of the use of armed force within their realms. These realms, too, had increasingly well-defined frontiers and thus expressed more than just an improvement in surveying. It marked a change in emphasis within government from a claim to control persons who had a particular relationship to the ruler to one to control people who lived in a certain area. Territorial dependence was, thus, replacing personal dependence.</p>
<p class="indent">Over such territorial agglomerations, royal power was by 1500 coming to be exercised directly through officials. Like cannon, they had to be paid, for a kingship which worked through vassals known to the king who did much of his work for him in return for his favours, and who supported him in the field when his needs went beyond what his own estates could supply, gave way to one in which royal government was carried out by its own employees, paid for by the taxation (more and more in cash, not kind), the raising of which was one of their most important tasks. The parchment of charters and rolls began by the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century to give way to the first trickles and rivulets of what was to become the flood of modern bureaucratic paper.</p>
<p class="indent">Europe was beginning by 1500 to organise itself in a way unlike the Europe of Carolingians and Ottonians. Though personal and local ties remained overwhelmingly the most important ones for most Europeans&ndash;and were to be for centuries&ndash;society was institutionalised in a different way from the 11<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century when even tribal survivals still counted. The relationship of lord and vassal which, with the vague claims of Pope and emperor in the background, so long seemed to exhaust political thought, gave way to an idea of princely power over all the inhabitants of a domain.</p>
<p class="indent">Necessarily, the change to such a state of affairs neither took place everywhere in the <a id="calibre_link-177" class="calibre10"></a>same way nor at the same pace. By 1800, France and England had been for centuries unified in a way that Germany and Italy were still not. But wherever it happened, the centre of the process was usually the steady aggrandisement of royal families. Kings had great advantages in different fields of administration and additionally could make use of several new forces that were emerging.</p>
<p class="indent">One such force was the sense of nationhood. This is another idea which modern man takes for granted, but we must be careful not to antedate the moment at which men began to think of themselves as Englishmen and Frenchmen. No medieval state was national in our sense. Nevertheless, by 1500, the subjects of the kings of England and France could often think of themselves as different from aliens who were not their fellow-subjects, even if they might also regard people who lived in the next village as virtually foreigners.</p>
<p class="indent">We must not exaggerate the immediate impact of such developments. For centuries yet, family, local community, religion or trade were still to be the only focus of most men’s loyalties. Such national institutions as they could have seen growing among them would have done little to break into this conservatism. The rural parishes and little towns of the Middle Ages, on the other hand, were communities, and in ordinary times they exhausted any man’s need to go further in thinking about social responsibilities. We really need another word than ‘nationalism’ to suggest the realm which might once in a while touch a medieval man, or even the irritation which might suddenly burst out in a riot against the presence of foreigners, whether workmen or merchants. Yet, such hints of national feeling occasionally reveal the slow consolidation of support for new states in Western Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">The first of them to cover anything like the areas of their modern successors were England and France. The Normans, a few thousands of whom came over from France to establish themselves after the invasion of 1066 as a new ruling class, were England’s last successful invaders. Their leader, William the Conqueror, gave them lands, but retained more for himself and asserted an ultimate lordship over the rest. For a long time, though, the Anglo-Norman Kings thought of themselves as something more than kings of an island state. They were heirs of a complex inheritance of possessions and feudal dependencies which at its furthest stretched far into South-Western France, and like their followers spoke Norman-French. The loss of most of this ‘Angevin’ inheritance at the beginning of the 12<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century was decisive for France as well as for England. A sense of nationhood was nurtured in each of them by their quarrels with one another.</p>
<p class="indent">The Capetians had hung on grimly and with increasing success to the French Crown. From the 10<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> to the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, their kings succeeded one another in unbroken hereditary succession. The Capetians’ lands fell in the heartland of modern France, the cereal-growing area around Paris, which was for a long time the only part of the country bearing the old name of France, thus commemorating the fact that it was a fragment of the old kingdom of the French. The domains of the first Capetians were so distinguished from the other west Carolingian territories, such as Burgundy; that by 1300, their successors had expanded ‘Francia’ to include other areas. By then the French kings had also acquired Normandy and other feudal dependencies from the English kings.</p>
<p class="indent">This is a reminder that in the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century (and later), there were still great fiefs and feudal principalities of the Capetian kingdom as a monolithic unity. Yet it was a unity of sorts, though much rested on the personal tie. During the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, that unity was greatly enhanced by a long struggle with England remembered by the misleading name of the Hundred Years’ War. In fact, the English and <a id="calibre_link-178" class="calibre10"></a>French were only sporadically at war from 1337 to 1453, fighting being far from continuous. Yet it was always easy to make it flare up again in a new campaign because the opportunities it offered to English noblemen for booty and ransom money made war seem a plausible investment to many of them. On the other hand, sustained warfare was difficult to keep up; it was too expensive. Formally, what was at stake was the maintenance by the kings of England of territorial and feudal claims on the French side of the Channel.</p>
<p class="indent">For England, the long-run looser, the most important immediate results of these quarrels were new additions to the infant mythology of nationhood and the creation of a long-living distrust of the French. Dislike was heartily reciprocated: after all, the campaigning took place in France. The Hundred Years’ War was also indirectly important to the French monarchy because it did something to check feudal fragmentation and moved French men about, breaking down the barriers. In France, too, the national mythology benefitted; its greatest acquisition was the story and example of Joan of Arc whose astonishing career accompanied the turning of the long struggle against the English. After 1453, French kings could push forward with the consolidation of their state undisturbed by the obscure claims of England’s rulers from which the wars had sprung. They could settle down to establish their sovereignty over their rebellious magnates at their leisure. In each country, war in the long run strengthened the state.</p>
<p class="indent">Such a clear outcome to the process of national consolidation was to be seen in only one other Western kingdom, Spain, whose rise had been made easier by the Reconquest, the long struggle against Islam, which from the start gave Spanish nationhood a quite special flavour because of its intimate connection with Christian faith and fervour. Portugal in the peninsula remained outside the New Spain, clinging to an independence often threatened by her powerful neighbour.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, by 1500 much of the political ground-plan of modern Europe was in being. England, France, Spain and Portugal were recognisable in their modern form, though in Italy and Germany, where vernacular language defined nationhood, there was no correspondence between the nation and the state.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did they Emerge?</b></i></span> The decline of feudalism curtailed the powers of the feudal lords and enabled capable rulers to assert their authority. Kings had great advantages viś-a-vis the feudal lords. If they managed their affairs carefully, they would have had a more solid base for their power than their nobles in their own domains. Their office had a mysterious aura about it which reflected in various royal ceremonies. Their judicial machinery seemed to promise a more independent, less expensive justice than could be got from the local feudal lords. They could, therefore, appeal not only to the resources of the feudal structure at whose head they stood, but also to forces outside that structure such as the sense of nationhood (which was slowly but steadily gaining ground in Europe), the spirit of Renaissance and Reformation, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">The spirit of nationalism or the sense of nationhood was slowly revealing itself as of growing importance by the end of the Middle Ages. By 1500, the subjects of the kings of England and France could often think of themselves as different from foreigners who were not their follow-subjects. Even 200 years earlier, this sort of difference between those born within and those born outside the realm was being made. An important sign of this enhanced sense of community of the native born was the appearance of belief in national patronsaints such as St. George for England. Another example was the writings of national histories and the discovery of national heroes such as Arthur for Welsh and Brain Boru for <a id="calibre_link-179" class="calibre10"></a>Irish. Moreover, there was the development of vernacular languages into national literary languages. Spanish, Italian, French and English one after another began to break through the barrier set by Latin about literary creativity. The ancestors of these tongues are recognisable in the 12<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century romances such as the song of Roland (which transformed a defeat of Charlemagne by Pyrenean mountaineers into a glorious stand of his rear guard against the Arabs), or the poem of Cid (the Spanish national hero). With the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century came Dante, Langland and Chaucer, each of them writing in a language modern man could read with ease. Then came the renaissance writers, poets and dramatists who completely raised the vernacular languages to a position of national literary languages.</p>
<p class="indent">The decline of feudalism, the urbanisation and the commercial revolution were supplementary factors in the growth of the spirit of nationalism, while war accentuated national centralisation. Patriotism, for instance, goaded people to support the governments of France and England in the long-drawnout struggle of the Hundred Years’ War (1337&ndash;1453). Henry V of England succeeded in gaining popular approval for his claim to the French throne, and Joan of Arc infused in the French people an impassioned support for the defense of their country. Spanish nationalism was achieved in the struggle with the Moors and was taken to fruition in the conquest of the New World.</p>
<p class="indent">The emergence of the urban middle class, along with increased trade and commerce, was another crucial factor in the emergence of the nation-states. The city people, in their own interests, favoured strong and absolute rulers. Commercial rivalries led the merchants to look for support of their respective rulers and this served to foster and promote a feeling of nationality which in turn facilitated the rise of nation-states.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Where and when did they Emerge?</b></i></span> France appeared to be a separate kingdom as early as the 9<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, but in the 13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century also, Philip Augustus was trying to assert his power against the feudal lords. Even in the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, there were still feudal principalities in what is now France which is quite jarring. During the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, the unity was greatly strengthened by a protracted struggle with England in the form of the so-called Hundred Years’ War. For France, the long-run winner, this war had two advantages. First, it strengthened the French monarchy because it prevented feudal fragmentation in the face of threat from the foreigners and thus helped the French kings to consolidate their authority. Secondly, it helped the infant nationhood. Joan of Arc roused the patriotic sentiments of the French and led the French army in liberating the Northern half of France from England. Thus, by the close of the war, French monarch was a national ruler and France was on the threshold of becoming a modern state.</p>
<p class="indent">In England, William the Conqueror, founded a strong monarchy in the 11<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Though in the following 200 years, the feudal lords enhanced their power, during the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, they began to lose out to the king. For the growth of trade and commerce, of cities and the rise of the middle classes together increased the financial and military powers of the king. Then the Hundred Years’ War resulted in new additions to the English national mythology, though England came out as the long-run loser in this war. The “War of the Roses” (1455&ndash;85) fought between two groups of feudal Lords for control over the monarchy finally brought down feudalism in England by weakening the lords and by creating a feeling of despair among the people with feudal anarchy. Henry VII, the first king of the Tudor dynasty, established a strong monarchy with the help of the middle classes. The English monarchy grew in strength under the other Tudor rulers in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, <a id="calibre_link-180" class="calibre10"></a>and the people of England began to think of themselves more clearly as a nation.</p>
<p class="indent">Such a clear process was evident in only one other Western kingdom, viz., Spain. She, too, achieved an important measure of unity by the end of the 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. It was first facilitated by the reconquest which was a Christian crusade against Islam bringing together men of different origins. In 1340, when the final Arab offensive was reversed, success brought in its wake the threat of political anarchy in the form of rebellions by nobles. But the monarchy, in alliance with the urban middle classes, succeeded in establishing its rule. Prior to this final triumph of monarchy, however, there was the union of the crown of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1479. The final expulsion of the Moors and the eventual creation of one nation soon followed, though the two kingdoms of Aragon and Castile continued their separate existence for some more time while pursuing common policies.</p>
<p class="indent">Portugal and Holland were also on their way to becoming nation-states. But it was not the same in the case of Italy and Germany. Neither was to be a ‘nation-state’ until the second half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, though feudalism had ceased in both of them by 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. In Italy, a strong middle class had arisen as a result of trade with East, but the interference of the Pope and other powers (Austria, France, etc.,) in her affairs prevented her from becoming a single nation-state.</p>
<p class="indent">In Germany, on the other hand, the dukes were powerful and zealously guarded their power. They were more interested in interfering in the affairs of Italy than in making Germany a strong united nation state.</p>
<p class="indent">By the middle of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the concept of “nation-state” was very much accepted in Europe, and it was legally recognised by the Treaty of West-phalia in 1648, though there were still some countries, such as Germany and Italy, which were only nations but not nation-states yet.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Outcome?</b></i></span> The balance sheet of the emergence of nationstates had quite a few entries on both sides. On the credit side, we can mention following points: The new nation-states not only succeeded in putting an end to the extreme disorder and anarchy of the feudal times, but also destroyed serfdom in countries where it had not already disappeared. They boosted the economic development by improving the ways of working to produce and exchange things that people needed. The replacement of militaristic and arbitrary limits of ancient empires and medieval estates by more rational boundaries was a thing achieved by their emergence. They also brought together people who shared common cultural traits, and thus enabled many groups of people to develop their talents. Moreover, in the wake of their emergence, people found several ways of self-expression and have made special contributions that the people of the whole world can share.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, the debit side is not clean. A strong feeling of nationalism, for instance, grew up in each state with several ill effects. This led to national jealousies, rivalries and conflicts over matters like trade in the beginning, and later on over the issue of acquisition of colonies in Asia, Africa and the America. Thus, the greed of these nation-states for colonies, maximum profits and national glory led to many wars among them. Besides, their rulers, eager to put Machiavellian theories into practice, had consideration for no interest other than their own, and respected no other authority on matters of national interest.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Thirty Years War: Consolidation of State System</b></h3>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">General Survey</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent">The 30 years war, which began in central Europe in 1618 as a religious struggle between Protestant and Catholic rulers, became a fight for political power between the Bourbon rulers of France and the Hapsburgs of Austria <a id="calibre_link-181" class="calibre10"></a>and Spain. The war eventually involved all major European nations except England. It was fought almost entirely in Germany. The failure of the Treaty of Augsburg (1555) to settle all of Germany’s religious problems was the cause of the war. This treaty, ending the fight during the Reformation, had allowed each ruler of Germany’s 300 odd independent states to choose either Catholicism or Lutheranism as it official religion. But the treaty did not allone Calvinism. It also did not prevent the seizure of Catholic Church lands by Protestant German rulers. There was continuous rivalry among the princes, some of whom wanted independence.</p>
<p class="indent">Early fighting in Bohemia soon developed into a series of wars. When troops of the Holy Roman Empire put down the Bohemian revolt in 1620, the Protestant rulers in Germany, Denmark, and Sweden were angered. Denmark entered the war in 1625, and invaded Northern Germany, but Catholic armies led by Albrecht Wildenstein of Bohemia drove them out. Sweden went to the aid of the Protestants in 1630. King Gustavns led the Swedish army to several victories but he was killed in battle in 1632. Hapsburg rulers supported the Catholics in all these struggles.</p>
<p class="indent">France entered the war in 1635 when King Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu saw a chance to strike a blow against the Hapsburg rulers of Austria and Spain. Although France was largely a Catholic country, it supported the Protestant Sweden to keep the Catholic Hapsburgs from encircling France. France generals led their forces to victory over the Catholic allies of Austria, Germany and Spain.</p>
<p class="indent">The treaty of Westphalia signed in 1648, ended the 30 years’ war. It made changes in Europe’s map and France’s leading power. Hapsburg power in Germany and Spain declined. The treaty gave France most of Alsace and recognised France’s legal ownership of Metz, Verdun and Toul. Sweden received German along the Baltic and North Seas. The German state of Brandenburg received lands in Northern Germany. The independence of the Dutch Netherlands and Switzerland was recognised. In Germany, Calvinism was granted the same privileges as Lutheranism. All former Catholic Church lands were declared to be the property of those who had held them on January 1, 1624. Unfortunately the 30 Years’ War had tragic results in the thousands of deaths and great destruction it caused throughout Germany.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Thirty Years War?</b></i></span> Though the war (1618&ndash;48) started as a local conflict in Bohemia (a German principality), it soon spread to the whole of Germany and developed into a mighty struggle between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Later, the war even lost its original character of a religious struggle and became a political contest between the House of the Hapsburgs and the House of the Bourbons. At the centre of this war was a Hapsburg attempt to assert the imperial authority in Germany. Once again, cross-currents made nonsense of simple ideological conflict. As Hapsburgs and Valois (the ruling dynasty in France before the Bourbons) had disputed Italy in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, Hapsburgs and Bourbons had disputed Germany in the next, i.e., 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Dynastic interest brought Catholic France into the field against the Catholic Hapsburgs under the leadership of Richelieu. France which was known as the ‘eldest daughter of the Church’, allied paradoxically with the Calvinist Dutch and Swedish Lutherans to assure the rights of the German princes.</p>
<p class="indent">The Peace of Westphalia which closed the 30 Years War was in several ways a turning point in European history. It brought the era of religious wars in Europe to a close. It also ended Spanish military supremacy on land and the dream of rebuilding the empire of a Charles V. It closed, too, an era of Hapsburg history. Hence forth the dynasty’s future was an Austrian one, <a id="calibre_link-182" class="calibre10"></a>however, much of its rulers sought to revive their power in Germany. There, a new power had appeared in the Electorate of Brandenburg, with which later Hapsburg power in Germany had been the work of outsiders, viz., France and Sweden. Here was the real sign of the future in Westphalia. A period of French ascendancy was beginning in Europe.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Reasons for the War?</b></i></span> Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II of Austria, wanted to consolidate his own position and secured a united Germany under his personal control. He saw a golden opportunity to achieve his aim in the prevailing religious confusion in Germany. But the German princes, who had become stronger during the Reformation, had their own plans. They desired complete independence from the controlling authority of the Emperor. Since the German Protestant states were the principal enemies of the imperial authority, the Emperor sought to destabilise them with the help of the Catholic League (formed by the Catholics to protect their own interests). The growth of the Emperor’s power was, however, a threat to the cherished independence of the local princes, and this possibility sent warning signals even to the Roman Catholic states. The apprehensions of the local princes introduced a political element into the struggle and gave the Protestants there a chance of survival.</p>
<p class="indent">Ostensibly, the primary factor of the war was extreme hostility between Roman Catholicism <a id="calibre_link-183" class="calibre10"></a>and Protestantism. The irreconcilable character of the two rival sects would not allow any satisfactory settlement and so there was extreme bitterness of feeling between the two.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00018.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">30 Years War in Germany</p>
<p class="indent">The Peace of Augsburg (1555) that concluded after the first religious war in Germany, viz. the Schmalkaldic War, had several defects which caused constant discord between the Catholics and the Protestants. For one, it left the settlement of religion in the hands of the German princes without any consideration for the religious convictions of their people. Then, one of its articles, called the ‘Ecclesiastical Reservation’, provided that a bishop joining the Protestant religion would have to give up his office with all its possessions. This unjust and partial provision proved to be a constant source of conflict between the rival creeds. Finally, the peace totally neglected the Calvinists, another vibrant sect of Protestantism. Calvinism was, therefore, in a secure position due to this denial of the legal recognition for its existence.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, the Counter-Reformation made rapid progress. The Jesuits, its torch-bearers, not only halted the tide of the Protestant progress but also regained greater portion of Germany to the Roman Catholic Church. The Jesuit efforts were supported by Emperor Rudolf III, who gave up his predecessor’s policy of toleration. The Catholic reaction was also helped by the mutual jealousy between the Lutherans and the Calvinists. The Catholics naturally took up an aggressive attitude and began to thwart the Protestants in every possible way. So, the Protestants, especially the Calvinists, were goaded to form a defensive league, known as the ‘Union’. And the Catholics, in turn, came up with their own ‘Catholic League’. Thus, when both sides were at their wits end, Bohemian happening provided the necessary spark.</p>
<p class="indent">The people of Bohemia were predominantly Protestants. They were not, therefore, well disposed to Emperor Ferdinand II for his anti-Protestant policy. But the dissatisfaction of the people surfaced only when, at this instance, a Protestant Church was destroyed at Prague. Its people rebelled, threw the royal officers out of the castle, and offered the crown to Frederick, the Elector of Palatine. Frederick’s acceptance of the crown was a direct challenge to Ferdinand and the 30 Years War had begun.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How and when did it Take Place?</b></i></span> The war can be divided into four stages or phases, each one signifying the shifting scenes of war and the participation of other powers in the struggle.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space">1.</span>The Bohemian Phase (1618&ndash;23)</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space">2.</span>The Danish Phase (1624&ndash;29)</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space">3.</span>The Swedish Phase (1630&ndash;34)</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space">4.</span>The French Phase (1635&ndash;48)</p>
<p class="indent1">Emperor Ferdinand II got the help of Catholic League (headed by Maxmilan of Bavaria) for a clash with the Protestants. Their combined forces not only defeated Protestants but also succeeded in driving Frederick of Palatine (head of Protestant Union) into exile. The Catholics were, thus, successful during the first phase as evident in the suppression of Protestantism in Bohemia. The travails of Frederick (who was a Calvinist), however, alarmed the hitherto indifferent Lutherans. Further, the Protestant rulers of Europe began to keenly watch the happening in Germany and started sympathising with the Protestant cause.</p>
<p class="indent">Denmark was the first among the several foreign powers to interfere in the German affairs and participate in the war. The Danish King, Christian IV, was very keen on taking up the cudgels against the Emperor (Ferdinand II) on behalf of the Protestants of Germany. He received huge amounts from the Protestant king of England, Charles I. But he was disgraced by the forces of the Catholic League on two occasions, and was compelled to abstain from further interference in German affairs. After Denmark’s exit from the war, the Emperor issued the ‘Edict of Restitution’ (1629) by <a id="calibre_link-184" class="calibre10"></a>which the Protestants were asked to return to the Catholic Church all ecclesiastical property which they had taken over since the Peace of Augsburg. This edict marks the peak of the Roman Catholic success. But since this extreme step affected majority of the Protestants, even the slothful Lutherans were stirred to activity, and they temporarily sank their differences and made common cause with the Calvinists against the Catholics. Thus the edict dashed any hope of a permanent settlement.</p>
<p class="indent">Sweden, the next foreign power to take part in the war, had both religious and political motives in doing so. The Swedes were staunch Lutherans, and their king, Gustavus Adolphus, regarded it to be his duty to protect the Protestant cause in Germany. From the political angle, the Swedish king hoped to control the entire Baltic coast and thereby make the Baltic Sea a Swedish lake. Moreover, he viewed the extension of the Emperor’s influence along the Northern coast of Germany as a threat not only to his above ambition but also to the safety of his state. France, though a Catholic state, entered into an agreement with the Swedish king against the Emperor for political reasons, i.e., to weaken the power of the Hapsburgs. Besides, all the Protestant princes of Germany finally decided to support the Swedish <i class="calibre8">Origins of Modern Politics</i> king. The forces of Sweden and Protestant princes of Germany together scored a convincing victory over those of the Catholic League at Breitenfield (1631) resulting in their triumph in North Germany. This victory not only nullified the impact of the Counter-Reformation but also saved Protestantism in North Germany. The Swedes once again triumphed over the Catholics at Lutzen (1632), but this time at the cost of their king’s life. Gustavus’s death was a severe blow to the cause of Protestantism in Germany, and almost negated their victory at Lutzen. For, he was the rallying point for the forces of Protestantism in Germany. Soon, the Catholic forces turned the tables on the Swedes at Nordelingen (1634), and gained control of South Germany. This was a turning point in the course of the war, because it paved the way for the entry of France, which was hitherto rendering only financial assistance to the Swedes against the Emperor. France’s assistance ended the religious nature of the war, for it now became a purely political conflict between the Hapsburgs and the Bourbons.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1635, France declared war on the Hapsburgs of both Austria and Spain. Initially, the Austrians and the Spanish seemed to have an upper hand, soon the French-Swedish duo turned the tide in their favour. The Swedes scored a number of victories, including the one at Wittstock. While the Swedes steadily moved southwards, the French patiently pushed across the Rhine. The French, led by Richelieu first and later by Mazarin, won a number of important battles against both the Spanish and the Austrians. The new Austrian Emperor, Ferdinand III (who succeeded Ferdinand II) was gradually reduced to a position of helplessness, and finally signed the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Outcome?</b></i></span> The political outcome of the war was much more significant than both the religious and the socio-economic outcome. First of all, the war led to the total disintegration of the Holy Roman Empire. By undermining the imperial authority while recognising the almost sovereign status of the princes, the Treaty of Westphalia strengthened the separatist tendency of the component states, and thereby destroyed whatever lingering notion of unity the Empire had. Not surprisingly, this treaty recognised Switzerland and Holland (Netherlands) as sovereign nation-states. The Empire ceased to exist as a reality and henceforth the Emperor was not more than an Austrian monarch.</p>
<p class="indent">More importantly, Germany underwent political rearrangement. By the terms of the treaty, Germany was cut up into more than 300 independent principalities whose princes <a id="calibre_link-185" class="calibre10"></a>maintained their own courts, armies and laws. Consequently, Germany became a loose confederation of states devoid of any notion of national identity or political unity. Besides, there were some important territorial changes affected in Germany. While Bavaria kept one portion of the Palatine, another portion of it was given back to the son of Frederick I. Brandenburg also acquired some new territories, including a part of Pomeranian, and it soon emerged as the mighty kingdom of Prussia which eventually banished Austria from Germany and achieved her political unification.</p>
<p class="indent">The war also resulted in the territorial expansion of France and Sweden and their ascendancy. By the terms of the treaty, France received three Bishoprics (Matz, Toul and Verdun) and most of Alsace (except the city of Strassburg and certain districts) from the Holy Roman Empire. The Alsatian land, in particular, gave France a foothold on the Rhine and open door to Germany. Sweden, on its part, secured the German lands along the Baltic and North Seas. These territorial gains made her one of the leading European powers of the time and secured her the mastery of the Baltic. Thus, the war resulted in the breakdown of the predominance of the Hapsburgs in Europe and the beginning of French ascendancy under the Bourbons.</p>
<p class="indent">In the religious field, the war restored the pre-war status-quo. The Southern and Western Germany remained Catholic, while the Northern part continued to be Protestant as before. Concerning the quarrels between the rival forces over Church property, it was settled that 1624 would be the cut-off year, and whatever land and other property that each side possessed in that year would remain so in future. Above all, Calvinism was finally given legal recognition in Germany.</p>
<p class="indent">Germany, in particular, had to bear the brunt of the war. Her population was drastically reduced, about two-third of it perished by either the sword or famine or pestilence. Cities declined, farmsteads and villages vanished and much of the country fell back into wilderness. Thus, the industry and agriculture of Germany were ruined considerably and a long period of moral and intellectual stagnation followed.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Significance?</b></i></span> The 30 Years War was a turning point in European history; it marked the end of an era of religious wars and the beginning of the era of political wars and aggrandisement. National rivalries which were hitherto caused and characterised by religious antagonisms would now take the shape of dynastic wars and struggle for colonial empire. This point is evident from the course of this war itself, which began as a religious war but ended as a dynastic struggle.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides, the territorial readjustments that were affected after the war laid the foundations of the future political history of Europe. The resultant changes in the relative position of powers contained the germs out of which developed the future complications of European history. The territorial gains of France, for instance, at the cost of Germany, though paved the way for the ascendancy of France, also caused the future rivalry between France and Germany for the control of Rhineland for the next 300 years. The rising power of Brandenburg, too, due to territorial enlargement, paved its way for the rise of modern Prussia. The Hapsburgs of Austria, after incurring heavy losses in Germany, began to seek compensation on the Danube for their losses on the Rhine, which resulted in future rivalry between Austria and Russia for the control of the Danube and for the share of the territory of the Turks in the East. Thus, a number of international problems which decided the future course of European history can be traced to the war.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the war and the treaty gave legal recognition to the concept of sovereignty and also a boost to the growth of international law. Though some sovereign nation-states had already come into existence in Europe by this time (e.g., France, England, Spain, etc.) it was after this war that the concept of sovereign nation-state was given legal sanction. The pretensions of the Holy Roman Emperor to the temporal leadership of Europe and Pope to universal spiritual supremacy were denied by the events of the war. As a result, equality of status and complete independence became the basis of the nation-state system in Europe. The Pope had now been deprived of his position as an international mediator, and the treaty showed that the public law of Europe was to be framed by diplomats and congresses of ambassadors. Further, the necessity of having an international code for regulating the mode of warfare was now felt more acutely that at any other time. A number of books on international law began to be published, the most important of them being book, <i class="calibre8">Law of War and Peace</i> by Grotius, known as the ‘Father of International Law’.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Ascendancy of France</b></h3>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">General Survey</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent">Religious civil wars were fought in France by Protestant and Catholic nobles following the assassination of King Henry III in 1589. Henry of Navarre, leader of the Protestant French Huguenots, was the heir in line to succeed Henry III, but French Catholics and King Philip II of Spain tried to deny Henry the throne. With the help of Queen Elizabeth I of England, Henry won his fight and was crowned in 1594 as King Henry VI of France. He was the first of the Bourbon Dynasty, which ruled France for 200 years.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-187" class="calibre10"></a>Henry IV became a Catholic when he took the throne but he did not turn against his former religious supporters. In 1598, Henry IV issued the Edict of Nantes which granted political and some religious freedom to the Huguenots and ended the bitter religious wars. The Huguenots were a minority, or represented less than half of the French population but many lived in the large cities. France was Europe’s first major nation that legally recognised more than one form of Christianity.</p>
<p class="indent">He brought peace and wealth to France. The French made Quebec their first permanent settlement in the New World. As an example of France’s religious freedom, Henry IV chose Duke of Sully, a Huguenot, as his chief minister to carry out domestic reforms. Both the king and Sully believed in the policy of Mercantilism. But, Henry IV was assassinated by an insane monk in 1610. With the King’s son, Louis XIII, only nine years old, his mother, Marie <i class="calibre8">de’</i> Medici, became the regent. Marie, a Catholic, would not employ Huguenots and dismissed Sully as chief minister. The government of France again fell under dishonest influences.</p>
<p class="indent">Louis XIII took control of the government in 1617 when he was 16 years old. Marie was relieved of authority, and most of her advisors and helpers were dismissed. But Louis XIII, who, like his father, chose capable helpers, kept one of Marie’s favourites, Cardinal Richelieu. Richelieu, a cardinal in the Catholic Church, was a skilled politician and leader. King Louis XIII, incapable of ruling by himself, recognised this and gave him almost full authority. Cardinal Richelieu’s two main goals were to strengthen the rule of the French king and to make France a powerful nation. As King Louis XIII’s Chief Minister from 1624 until his death in 1642, Richelieu was the strongest influence in France’s government. He believed that changes and programs for the good of France were more important than his religious work and seemed willing to use any method he considered necessary to carry out his programs for France.</p>
<p class="indent">The Protestant Huguenots and the nobles of France had their political powers taken away by Richelieu. The minister believed that king Henry IV’s Edict of Nantes, giving Huguenots the right to govern fortified cities, was dangerous. In 1627, Richelieu sent French troops against the Huguenot-controlled seaport of La Rochele and other armed towns. England tried to help Huguenots but could not send strong forces. The Huguenots asked for peace, and the fighting ended. Although they lost their right to rule independent towns, Huguenots were allowed freedom of worship and the right to hold public offices and to attend schools.</p>
<p class="indent">Military power of the nobles was reduced when Richelieu ordered many of their fortified castles be destroyed. Richelieu’s next step was to increase the king’s political power by eliminating the nobles’ rule over local provinces and appointing officials directly responsible to the king.</p>
<p class="indent">Richelieu supported trade and industrial expansion and favoured the growth of France’s colonial empire. The expenses of maintaining a strong army put heavy tax loads on the French people. New taxes were abolished or old ones were raised without approval of the law-making council, the Estates-General. The 30 Years War was being fought in Europe. Germany and the Hapsburgs were weakened, but France came out of the war as a powerful European nation.</p>
<p class="indent">When Louis XIII died in 1643, his son, Louis XIV, heir to the French throne, was only five years old. Again Catholic, Cardinal Mazarin served Louis XIV as capably and loyally as Cardinal Richelieu had served Louis XIII. When Mazarin died in 1661, Louis XIV, by then 23 years old, personally took over the government. By the time his reign ended in 1715, Louis XIV had ruled for 54 years and had become one of Europe’s notable kings, called the ‘Sun King’ <a id="calibre_link-188" class="calibre10"></a>by his court followers. He was also known as the ‘Grand Monarch’ throughout Europe. He believed that kings were chosen by God to rule (divine right). Speaking of the government, Louis XIV said, “I am the state”.</p>
<p class="indent">To lead France to the glory that he planned, Louis XIV named Jean-Baptiste Colbert his Finance Minister. Colbert believed in mercantilism and built manufacturing at home and French trade abroad. To compete with the English and Dutch East India Companies, the French East India Company was formed in 1664. Colbert financed French trading posts in North America, India, the West Indies, and the Far East.</p>
<p class="indent">Louis XIV was determined to make France a centre of culture. He supported art and literature. Many well-known French plays and novels were written during his reign. The palace of Louis XIV became a famous landmark. The palace, built at Versailles, a village about ten miles from Paris, cost over one hundred million dollars and took 32 years to complete. When the king moved the government headquarters to Versailles, both he and his nobles lost any contact they had with the French people.</p>
<p class="indent">France’s Protestant Huguenots were angered when Louis XIV, a strong Catholic, revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685. This deprived the Huguenots of the religious freedom which the edict had given them. Although forbidden to leave, an estimated one lakh Huguenots left France to live in America, England and Holland. Many were skilled workmen, and their departure hurt France’s industry and economy.</p>
<p class="indent">Louis XIV put France heavily in debt through construction of the palace at Versailles, loss of Huguenot services, and four wars that were fought between 1667 and 1713. Louis XIV wanted more territory for France and wanted a boundary on the Rhine river. In the various wars, France was opposed by alliances of the Spanish Netherlands (Belgium), England, Sweden, German states, Austria and Spain. While Louis XIV gained some land, no territory was won along the Rhine River.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Reasons for its Ascendancy?</b></i></span> The French ascendancy was based on certain natural advantages. France was the most populous state of Western Europe and this was mainly responsible for its military strength till the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Besides, France was endowed with economic resources, which provided the necessary financial strength for its rise into prominence.</p>
<p class="indent">France also had the fortune to be served by some capable people, like Richelieu, Mazarin, Louis IV and Colbert in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Their contribution was equally responsible, if not more, for the ascendancy of France. Richelieu, the Chief Minister of Louis XIII, aimed at making monarchy supreme in France and France supreme in Europe. Mazarin, his political follower and Chief Minister of Louis XIV, faithfully carried out his policy with remarkable success. Consequently, the Hapsburgs, who had dominated Europe in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, were humiliated in the 30 Years War, and the ascendancy of France in Europe began.</p>
<p class="indent">This fine start given to France by its two Chief Ministers was the real foundation for the legendary reign of Louis XIV. At the age of 23, he announced his desire to manage his own affairs. His assumption of supreme power was a turning point in international history as well as that of France. For Louis was the most perfect exponent of the theory of divine right of kingship. The building of Versailles, for instance, had its justification not only in the gratification of a personal taste, but in buttressing the prestige which was as important to his diplomacy as was the strength of his armies. In one way or another, he pursued a foreign policy of expansion, which though in the end cost his country dearly, carried France to a pre-eminence from which she was to freewheel through half of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, and <a id="calibre_link-189" class="calibre10"></a>created a legend to which Frenchmen still look back with nostalgia.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Richelieu’s Contribution to it?</b></i></span> Throughout his chief ministership of 18 years he had two main objectives. On the one hand, he wanted to make French monarchy an absolute one, and on the other, he desired to extend the territories of France as much as possible in order to make her supreme in the whole of Europe. The former guided his domestic policy and the latter his foreign policy. In fact, the two are complementary to each other.</p>
<p class="indent">The various measures undertaken at the domestic level were aimed at realising the first objective. His first measure was destroying the political power of the Huguenots (French Calvinists). Though he was not against their faith, he was opposed to their enjoyment of certain special privileges, which were granted to them by the Edict of Nantes and which went against the absolute powers of the monarchy. After some military operations, the Huguenots were made to surrender, and by a treaty many of their privileges were abolished, though their religious liberty remained intact. Then Richelieu initiated measures against the nobles, who not only quarrelled among themselves but also defied the king. Some of the rebellious nobles were permanently silenced by judicial executions, while the rest were cowed down to submission. Next, he started a new system of appointing royal officials in the provinces as the direct representatives of royal power. These new officials, known as ‘Intendants’, were to look after the administration at the provincial level, which was hitherto done by the nobles themselves. This measure, while delivering a death blow to the political power of the nobles, did a lot to foster the growth of absolute monarchy in France. His last measure to strengthen absolutism in France was the undermining of the representative institutions of France. He refused to summon the Estates-General, the feudal parliament of France, and thus caused it to fall into disuse. He also reduced the powers of the provincial parliaments.</p>
<p class="indent">For attaining his other goal, i.e., making France supreme in Europe, he embarked upon an aggressive foreign policy. He was wise enough to realise that his main obstacle in this was the power of the House of Hapsburgs in both its branches, i.e., Austria and Spain. The dominions of these two powers almost encircled France and barred the extension of the French frontiers to their natural boundary, viz., the Rhine. Richelieu first took on Spain. His aim in doing this was to divert the attention of Spain, so that it could not give active help to the Holy Roman Emperor in the 30 Years’ War, and also it would not take steps to recover the revolted Netherlands. Fortunately, he found an opening for his policy in the disputes about the Valley of the Valtelline, which belonged to the Swiss Grisons. When the Spaniards occupied it, Richelieu interfered and succeeded in restoring it to the Grisons. But it was 30 Years’ War that brought out the best from Richelieu. Though he had little interest in the religious issues that were at stake in this war, he wanted to prolong the war and thereby weaken the Emperor in order to enable France to strike down and humiliate the Hapsburg at the right moment. Accordingly, during the first three stages he did not openly intervene in the war, but used diplomacy to keep the war alive. That is why, he gave financial assistance to the Protestant powers. In the final stage, however, he entered the war openly. He also involved Spain in great difficulties within her own peninsula by inciting Portugal and the province of Catalonia to revolt. Although, Richelieu did not live to see the fruition of his plan, he saw enough to be sure about their final outcome.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Mazarin’s Contribution?</b></i></span> Mazarin proved himself to be a worthy successor of Richelieu, on both foreign and domestic fronts. He came on the scene when the 30 Year’s War <a id="calibre_link-190" class="calibre10"></a>was drawing to a close and under his leadership France scored a spectacular victory over the Hapsburgs. He secured considerable gains to France through the Treaty of Westphalia. But the victory of France in the 30 Years’ War did not establish the undisputed authority of France in Europe. Spain, which still refused to make peace with France, was isolated by Mazarin through clever diplomacy. For instance, he prevented Emperor Leopold of Austria from supporting Spain by threatening to set up a rival candidate for the imperial throne. On the other hand, he himself secured the active cooperation of Cromwell of England by making concessions to the Protestant susceptibilities of the latter and also by promising territorial gains. Thus isolated, the Spanish were decisively defeated by the combined forces of France and England at the Battle of the Dunes, and were compelled to sign the Peace of Pyreneas in 1659. To cement this peace, Mazarin negotiated the marriage of Louis XIV with Maria Theresa, the eldest daughter of Spanish King, Philip IV. The Peace of Pyreneas was a great triumph for France and a severe humiliation for Spain. It secured for France a scientific frontier at the expense of Spain. The marriage alliance, which in fact, formed a part of the treaty, was a great stroke of far-sighted diplomacy on Mazarin’s part. For it opened before France the prospect of immense territorial gains.</p>
<p class="indent">On the domestic front, his greatest accomplishment was the suppression of the two Frondes (first and second or old and new) which established peace at home and facilitated the triumph of the absolute monarchy in France. By now the nobles were deeply resenting the loss of their powers and privileges during the chief ministership of Richelieu, and also the whole nation was weighed down by heavy taxation caused by the constant involvement of France in the wars. This rising disenchantment of the people led to a general uprising against Mazarin’s government. This general uprising is properly known as the “Fronde” (which is derived from the term ‘frondeurs’, a name given to street-arabs of Paris because of their game of stone slinging). There were, in fact, two Frondes. The first or old Fronde was a constitutional movement which aimed at establishing a more efficient system of administration. In this the Parliament of France, inspired by the British parliament, acted as the constitutional champion of the nation against ministerial irresponsibility and the unrestricted power of the crown. After initial hesitation, Mazarin sought to suppress the movement by force as well as bribery which dragged France into a civil war between the royal forces and the parliament supported by the people of Paris. After a while, peace was announced and a general amnesty was proclaimed, which ended the first or old Fronde.</p>
<p class="indent">France seemed to have settled down to peace, but soon trouble started again. This time, it took the form of selfish struggle for power between Mazarin and the queen-mother, on the one hand, and the discontented nobles, on the other hand, which is known as the second or new Fronde. Again, Mazarin succeeded in suppressing his opponents by bribery and brute force. An edict was issued denying the parliament of any control over the affairs of state finance and administration. Thus collapsed the second Fronde, and with it disappeared the last hopes of French nobility to reassert their power and recover their lost privileges.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Developments under Louis XIV?</b></i></span> Louis XIV began his reign under favourable circumstances. Under the able guidance of ministers like Richelieu and Mazarin, the French Government had become highly centralised and all obstacles to royal power had been removed. The two treaties of Westphalia and Pyreneas had secured France a scientific border and considerably added to her prestige. Louis XIV himself commanded the services of a group of able men, such as <a id="calibre_link-191" class="calibre10"></a>Colbert (Finance Minister) and Louvois (War Minister). With such advantages, Louis could have contributed to the permanent advancement of France. But he failed due to over-ambition. Entertaining grandiose plans of expansion, he entered upon a career of aggression and conquest, which after a few brilliant results, ended in his humiliation.</p>
<p class="indent">On the domestic front, he introduced a profound change into the government of France. It marked the end of ministerial ascendancy and the completion of centralised despotism. Louis, unlike his predecessors, not only reigned but also ruled. He suppressed every institution or section which might aspire to set limits to royal authority. The Estates General, for instance, was never summoned, the power of the nobles was crushed and the administration of the provinces was left in the hands of the “Intendants”. Although all signs of popular control were removed, the government still gained in administrative efficiency. For the king displayed untiring industry in the routine of administrative work and did not allow any important matter to escape his attention. Possessing a shrewd eye for character and ability, he entrusted the task of reforming the finances to Colbert and that of reorganising the army to Louvois, both of whom achieved phenomenal success in their respective departments.</p>
<p class="indent">Jean Colbert introduced various economic reforms, reorganised the national economy and improved the financial condition of the country. To begin with, he removed the dishonest tax collectors and ensured greater amount of tax-collection. Secondly, he lowered the direct taxes on land in order to promote agriculture. Thirdly, he encouraged the establishment of new industries and invited foreign skilled workers to come and settle down in France. Fourthly, high importduties were levied to encourage exports and discourage imports. Fifthly, he encouraged internal trade by removing various provincial duties. Sixthly, he constructed roads and canals to improve means of communication and transport. Finally, in order to promote foreign trade, he established colonies in Asia, Africa and America and helped French trading companies in all possible ways.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, by all these reforms, he built up the long neglected French economy and increased the income of the government. So, it was Colbert’s expert handling of the economy of France that not only made possible Louis’s programme for the cultural development of France but also helped her to withstand the strains of a series of costly wars. But in one important respect, Colbert’s reforms defeated their own objectives. They secured to the king a well-filled treasury and led him to imagine that his resources were inexhaustible. This inflamed the King’s natural lust for war and territorial aggrandisement. Consequently, Louis embarked upon a course of reckless warfare and profligate extravagance which were the two important features of his reign. That is why, it has been rightly remarked that without Colbert, the Louis XIV whom we all know would have been impossible.</p>
<p class="indent">The stable economy and vast resources created by Colbert, combined with his (Louis) own desire to complete the natural boundaries of France, led him to follow the policy of imperialism. Consequently, he fought four costly wars to expand the territories of France and enhance the military glory. The first of them is known as the “War of Devolution”, and it had its origin in the attempt of Louis to annex the Spanish Netherlands, i.e., Belgium. He claimed the whole of Belgium, because he was married to the daughter of King Philip IV of Spain. Since the Spanish king refused to oblige him, Louis waged a war against Spain in 1667. England, Holland and Sweden were united against Louis, and they all helped Spain against France. Ultimately, the Treaty of <i class="calibre8">Ain-La-Chapelle</i> was concluded, and France was allowed to retain the Southern part of Belgium, which was occupied by France during the course of the war.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-192" class="calibre10"></a>The second war was against the Dutch Netherlands. Louis XIV attacked Holland in 1672 AD because the latter had helped Spain against France and also offered shelter to the Huguenots of France. Besides, there was commercial and colonial rivalry between the two countries. While Sweden sided with France in this war, Spain, Austria and many German principalities rendered help to Holland. Finally peace was concluded in 1679, according to which France was given France Comte from Spain, Alsace from Austria, and Luxemburg, Strasburg and some Rhine cities also from the Austrian Empire.</p>
<p class="indent">The third war was the war of ‘League of Augsburg’ (1688&ndash;97). Louis XIV attacked Palatinate, the rich district of the Rhine in Germany, resulting in a war between France and the Leasue (consisting of Holland, Spain, Austria, Sweden, England and many German principalities). The war was ended by the Treaty of Ryswick (1697) by which France gave up all the territories it gained since 1680 except Strassburg. It was a serious blow to his power. It, for the first time, set a limit to his aggression. Henceforth, the personal duel between Louis XIV and William of Orange (who had now become the king of England) was transformed into national rivalry between England and France. Thus, it was the first war by which Louis XIV had gained nothing, which was a clear evidence of the increasing exhaustion of France.</p>
<p class="indent">The fourth and the last one was the war of Spanish Succession (1701&ndash;13). Charles II (King of Spain), who was heirless, appointed Philip (the grandson of Louis XIV) as his successor. At this, Austria waged a war against France and the former was aided by England, Holland and the leading German principalities. The war was brought to an end by the Treaty of Utrecht, by which Philip was recognised as the king of Spain, but Louis XIV was not allowed to amalgamate the two kingdoms. Though the territorial losses of France were insignificant, she emerged from the war terribly exhausted, with debts enormously increased and with her prestige in Europe diminished, if not totally destroyed. Thus, the war was disastrous to France in every respect.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-24"><b class="calibre9">AMERICAN REVOLUTION</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The American Revolution, or the War of American Independence, as it is sometimes called, was a revolt against the autocracy of England, which at this time was ruled by an obstinate king, George III. The Revolution was a direct consequence of England’s intervention in the Seven Years’ War, and of ideas which prevailed throughout Western Europe at that time as to the proper way of governing the colonies. It was thought that colonies were part of the parent country, and they should be administered not primarily for the benefit of the colonists, but for the benefit of the country from which the colonists had originally come. In accordance with this principle, England had on two occasions in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century passed laws known as Navigation Acts which enacted that colonial produce was to be exported only in British ships; some commodities were to be sent to no country but Britain; and some were to be shipped to Great Britain first and thence to other parts of the world, reshipping naturally forcing up prices. There were also laws passed restricting or prohibiting the manufacture of certain articles in colonies, such as cloth the idea being that if their manufactures were allowed, English industries of vital importance to the prosperity of the country would be seriously affected.</p>
<p class="indent">A leading characteristic of the 13 British colonies was their political independence. Their elective assemblies were continually at loggerheads with the governors and other officials sent <a id="calibre_link-193" class="calibre10"></a>out from London. Besides, Britain decisively defeated France in the Seven Years’ War and, by the Treaty of Paris of 1763, acquired France’s colonies north of the Arctic and West of the Mississippi. Both the British and the Americans felt considerable pride in the magnitude of their joint victory. But, at the same time that it settled old ones, the victory created new problems. One was the growing spirit of defiance in the 13 colonies, now that the danger of French attack had been removed. Another was the decision of the British government, following its acquisition of vast new colonial territories, to tighten its imperial organisation. This tightening would have been feasible at an earlier date, but now, after the elimination of the French danger, the colonists were convinced that they were able to take care of themselves and had every right to do so. Thus the American Revolution arose primarily out of the conflicting claims of British imperial authority and American colonial self-government.</p>
<p class="indent">Not all, or even most, of the American colonists favoured violent revolution. In fact, they were split into two antagonistic camps. The conservatives wanted to return to the loose relations between the mother country and the colonies that prevailed before 1763. The radicals, on the other hand, wanted a change in their relations with the British Empire that would give the colonies complete control of their own affairs. They also wanted a shift of political power inside the colonies in favour of the common people. On this point, the conservatives were violently opposed. They had no desire for democracy. Rather, they wished to retain upper class leadership after the fashion of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England. In the end the radicals had their way, because of the blunders of inept officials in Britain.</p>
<p class="indent">The steps leading to the Revolution are well known. First there was the Proclamation of 1763 prohibiting settlement west of a line drawn along the crests of the Appalachians. This was intended as a temporary measure to preserve peace until an orderly land policy could be worked out but the prospective settlers and speculators assumed that they were to be excluded forever for the benefit of the new British fur traders. Then there was a series of financial measures the Sugar Act, Quartering Act, Stamp Act, and the Townsend Duties to shift a part of Britain’s heavy tax load to the American colonists. These levies seemed reasonable to the British, especially since they had spent a great deal of money to defeat the French in the recent war, and since they estimated that they would have to spend even more in order to protect the American frontiers in future. But the colonists were all affected by these imposts and unanimously opposed them. They called a continental congress which organised a boycott of British goods to last until the financial measures were repealed. Another series of ill-considered measures by the British government started a fresh storm that was to lead to a revolution.</p>
<p class="indent">The sequence of the dramatic events is familiar, the East India Company’s tea monopoly, the Boston Tea party, and the Coercive, or Intolerable Acts intended as punishment for the vandalism in Boston harbour. At the same time, in 1774, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act, providing a governmental system for the conquered French Canadians and drawing the boundaries of Quebec to include all the territories north of the Ohio river. Much can be said in defence of the Quebec Act, but the American colonists denounced it as another Intolerable Act that blocked their westward expansion for the benefit of the Catholic French Canadians. The first Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in September 1774 and organised another boycott against British goods. Fighting began the next year when British troops set out from Boston to seize unauthorised stores of weapons <a id="calibre_link-194" class="calibre10"></a>at Concord. It was during this operation that someone fired at Lexington Green.</p>
<p class="indent">The outcome was that the British troops found themselves besieged in Boston. When the Second Continental Congress met the following month, in May 1775, it had a full-fledged war on its hands and proceeded to raise an American army.</p>
<p class="indent">The Congress was still reluctant to make the final break with the mother country. Sentiment for independence grew with the spread of fighting and the Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence in July 1796. Once military operations got fully under way, the decisive factor proved to be France’s aid to the revolutionaries. During the first two years of the war, France, although not officially involved, poured large amounts of a munitions into the colonies. The following year France signed an alliance with the insurgents and declared war on Britain. Holland and Spain joined France, while most of the other European powers formed an ‘Armed Neutrality’ to protect their commerce from Britain’s naval power. The help of the French navy and a French expeditionary force of 6000 men contributed substantially to the victories of George Washington’s forces and to the final British surrender at Yorktown in 1781. The peace treaty signed at Paris in 1783 recognised the independence of the American republic.</p>
<p class="indent">From the viewpoint of world history, the American Revolution is significant not because it created an independent state but because it created a new and different type of state. The Declaration of Independence proclaimed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal”. Now the American people, both during and after the Revolution, passed laws to make this declaration true in real life as well as on paper. They seized and distributed large estates owned by the Tories. They extended the franchise until all men (but not women) had the right to vote. Many state governments passed laws forbidding the importation of slaves. Established churches were abolished, and freedom of religion became the law of the land. All 13 states adopted constitutions which included bills of rights that guaranteed the natural rights of citizens.</p>
<p class="indent">These changes were not as far-reaching and fundamental as those that were brought about later by the French and Russian Revolutions. These later revolutions, and particularly the Russian, involved far more extensive social and economic reorganisation. Nevertheless, the American Revolution had a profound impact in its time. The establishment of an independent republic in the New World was widely interpreted in Europe as meaning that the ideas of the Enlightenment &ndash; that it was possible for people to establish a state and a workable system of government based on the rights of the individual. Thus, America became a symbol of freedom of opportunity, envied as a new land, free from the burdens and chains of the past.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was it?</b></i></span> By the early 1770s, the Northern part of North America was under the British Crown, France already driven out of North America. There were 13 British colonies in all, consisting of five Southern colonies of Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia; the four Northern colonies of Plymouth, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Miami; and the four middle colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. These colonies had diverse origins and nature. Besides the British, there were French, Swedish and Dutch settlements. Maryland had British Catholics, while New England (four Northern colonies) had British ultra-Protestants. The New Englanders cultivated land on their own and denounced slavery, whereas the British in Virginia and other Southern colonies were planters employing a larger number of imported Negro slaves. Commonness was naturally lacking in such states. Going from one state to The 13 British Colonies another was as difficult as crossing the Trans-Atlantic Ocean. The union that diverse origin and natural conditions denied was forced upon them (the British-Americans) by the selfishness and stupidity of the British government in London. They were taxed without any say in the spending of the taxes; their trade was sacrificed to British interests. Moreover, the obstinate personality of George III (1760&ndash;1820) prepared the inevitable struggle between the home and the colonies in America. This showdown between the British colonies in America and the motherland has come to be known as the American Revolution or the American War of Independence which happened between 1775 and 1783, resulting in the defeat of the British and the foundation of the United States of America. It is a landmark in the world history and had a significant and far-reaching impact on the subsequent history of humanity.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-195" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00072.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">The 13 British Colonies</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-196" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Happen?</b></i></span> The most important cause was the economic exploitation of the colonies by the British. To the English, the colonies were there for service of the mother country. Several restrictions were put on the colonies trade (both imports and exports) as well as industries. The Navigation Acts of 1651, 1660 and 1680, for example, gave monopoly to the English ships to carry goods to and from the colonies. These laws not only denied the American shipper his immediate source of income but also proved quite harmful for the industrial and commercial development of the colonies. Besides, the English controlled the production as well as exports and imports of the colonies. The colonies were not permitted to produce paper, hats, steel and woollen goods, so that they might not compete with the British in these goods. The colonies could import woollen and hardware goods only from England and not from any other country. They were also required to export items like cotton, coffee, sugar, tobacco, etc., to England alone. Goods exported from the colonies were, thus, sent to England first, and from there they were shipped to other European countries.</p>
<p class="indent">All these mercantilist rules and regulations were not strictly enforced by the British till 1760. However, when King George III ascended the throne in 1760, he tried to implement them strictly. For their proper enforcement, British troops were dispatched to America, and British agents were empowered to check smuggling and search private residences on suspicion. Further, the settlers were ordered not to move beyond the traditional border on the western side lest it should provoke the Red Indians. This order annoyed the fur traders and small farmers in the colonies. Businessmen were also antagonised as they hoped to buy Western lands cheaply.</p>
<p class="indent">The above problems were accentuated by the defective colonial administration. The colonies were administered by governors, captains and colonels who were the nominees of the British government. The colonies, of course, had their elected assemblies, but the governors were not responsible to them. This system resulted in conflict between the two branches of government, i.e., the executive and the legislative branches. This kind of defective system of government could not naturally take care of the interests of the local people properly and hence their resentment against it.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, the colonists were vehemently opposed to the British claim to the right to legislate and tax them, particularly when they did not have any representation in the British Parliament. But King George III compelled the British Cabinet to secure parliamentary sanction for imposing new taxes on the colonists. Consequently, the British Parliament passed the Sugar Act in 1764 by which duty was imposed on the colonists. The colonists, in turn, tried to smuggle molasses, but their activities, were curbed. In 1766, the British Parliament passed another legislation, viz., the Stamp Act, by which the colonists were required to register various <a id="calibre_link-197" class="calibre10"></a>legal documents, wills and licenses by affixing revenue stamps. But the colonists, protesting against this Act, burnt heaps of stamps and the effigies of stamp collectors on a large scale. The Stamp Act Congress, attended by delegates of nine colonies, met at New York and passed a resolution that the British Parliament had no right to tax the colonies without their consent. The slogan of this agitation was “No taxation without representation”. The British government, however, made a hasty retreat and repealed the Stamp Act, though it continued to insist on its right to tax the colonies.</p>
<p class="indent">This agitation had dual significance. First, the agitation was mainly directed not as such against the revenue to be raised through the purchase of stamps (for the amount was not significant) as the right of the British Parliament to tax the colonies. Secondly, it for the first time demonstrated the unity of all the nine colonies.</p>
<p class="indent">Townsend (Chancellor of Exchequer in Pitt’s Ministry) within two years levied duties on colonial imports of tea, paper, glass, sugar, paints, etc. The resultant public protest in the colonies was accompanied by a boycott of British goods by the merchants of Boston, Philadelphia and New York. Some colonists even advocated homemade manufacturers of all kinds. In the meanwhile, riots were taking place at various places. At Boston, for instance, there was firing on the protesters in which three people were killed. This incident was described as the “Boston Massacre” by Samuel Adams, leader of the agitation at Boston. However, the British government, during the Prime Ministership of Lord North, repealed all import duties except on tea.</p>
<p class="indent">The religious and temperamental differences between American colonists and people of England were other contributory factors. While most of the colonists were Puritans, people of England were followers of the Anglican Church. Besides, the colonists were liberal and broad minded, but the English were conservative and rigid. The long distance between the two countries and lack of proper means of communication weakened the ties between England and her colonies in America. Under these conditions, there was hardly any scope for compromise between the two and a showdown became inevitable.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, the colonists were gradually attaining self-sufficiency in their requirements. Initially they were dependent on England for the articles of daily use, but over a period of time, they took various steps to improve agriculture and industry. By manufacturing all the essential items in the colonies, they soon became self-sufficient and self-reliant. They were no longer dependent on England and were not eager to maintain any contact with the mother country. As such they tried to seek more autonomy and freedom.</p>
<p class="indent">The removal of the threat from the French played an equally important role. Though the English imposed various political and economic restrictions upon the colonies, the latter remained loyal to the mother country as long as there was the threat of French invasion of the colonies and Britain offered protection against such invasion. However, the conquest of Canada by the English after Seven Year’s War (1956&ndash;1963) removed any such threat to the colonies from the French. Instead, the colonies thought it futile to stick to the mother country and hence started their struggle for independence. As Montcalm, the French general who lost Quebec to the English, predicted: “England will soon repent of having removed the only check (by conquering Canada from the French) that could keep her colonies in awe”.</p>
<p class="indent">The American War of Independence was sparked off by an incident, called the “Boston Tea Party”, which occurred on 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> December 1773. Lord North abolished all the import <a id="calibre_link-198" class="calibre10"></a>duties imposed by Townsend, except the one on tea. The tax on tea was retained for a dual purpose. First, the British government was keen on keeping its right to tax the colonies. Secondly, Lord North wanted to help East India Company to dispose of its large stock of tea by selling them to the colonists. As usual there was popular opposition to this move and leaders in the colonies tried to prevent unloading of tea in the colonial ports. In Boston, Samuel Adams and his followers disguised themselves as the Red Indians and sneaked into East India Company’s ship, and threw all the 340 chests of tea into the water. The British government regarded it as an open defiance of its authority. By a series of acts, it withdrew the charter granted to Massachusetts colony, put Boston harbour under quarantine and banned political meetings there.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00101.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">These acts precipitated the matter further. The colony of Virginia took the lead and issued a call for a continental congress. Accordingly, the representatives of all the colonies, except Georgia, met at Philadelphia on 5 <sup class="calibre13">th</sup> September 1774, and drew up a Declaration of Rights asserting that the British Parliament had no right to tax the colonies without their consent. Denouncing the laws passed by the British government and demanding their repeal, it sent a petition, known as the “Olive Branch Petition”. The British government, however, refused to repeal these acts. At this, the colonies declared a war against England in 1775.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00127.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was the War Conducted?</b></i></span> Fighting began formally in 1775 when the British government tried to arrest two of the American leaders at Lexington near Boston. The first shots were fired in Lexington by the British and the first fighting took place at Concord. For more than a year the colonies were hesitant to cut off their links completely with the motherland. It was only in the middle of 1776 that the Congress of the rebel colonies (the second Continental Congress to meet in Philadelphia) issued the “Declaration of Independence”. George Washington, who like many of the leading colonists of the time had military training in the wars against the French, was made the Commander-in-Chief. In 1777, a British general, General Burgoyne, while trying to reach New York from Canada, was defeated at Freeman’s Farm and was compelled to surrender at Sartoga. In the same year, the French and the Spanish declared war upon Great Britain, greatly hindering her sea communications. A second British army under General Cornwallis was held up in the Yorktown peninsula in Virginia and made to surrender in 1781. In 1783, peace was made in Paris, and the 13 colonies from Maine to Georgia became a nation of independent sovereign states.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-199" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00010.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were its Results?</b></i></span> The American Revolution was a landmark not only in the history of the USA and Great Britain, but also in the history of the entire humanity. The long struggle of the colonists against the royal tyranny ended. Ideals enshrined in the Declaration of Independence were put into practice. The Americans chose a Republic in place of monarchy and built a democratic state. Its success became a source of inspiration to the colonists in Latin America who began to fight for their independence from their colonial rulers. It also gave inspiration to the French people to rebel against the tyrannical monarchy. In England, the mercantilist theories and policies underwent some important changes.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00035.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">The Revolution, first of all, led to the birth of a new independent state, namely, the United States of America. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles (1783), England recognised the independence of the 13 colonies. The new state gradually became one of the two most powerful countries of the world (the other being the Soviet Union). The Revolution engendered the spirit of nationalism and patriotism in America as well as abroad. It demonstrated the rights of the suppressed people to revolt against their autocratic rulers and regain their freedom.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1805, the Spanish colonies in South and Central America were to follow suit and break their connection with Europe. But being more dispersed over the continent and separated by natural barriers as well as Portuguese Empire of Brazil, they did not achieve a union among themselves. They became a constellation of republican states. Brazil became independent in 1822, though it retained its monarchical form of government until 1889 when it became a republic like the other American States.</p>
<p class="indent">Ireland had been under the domination of England and the Irish people were waiting for an opportunity to overthrow the oppressive rule of the English. Inspired by the American success and taking advantage of the situation, they launched a struggle for the legislative independence of their own country and ultimately succeeded in getting it. Many other European countries (e.g., Belgium and Greece) and in the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century many Asian and African countries followed the example of the USA and freed themselves from the bondage of colonial rule and slavery.</p>
<p class="indent">After the war, the Americans adopted the democratic form of government based on the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity, instead of the monarchical form of government. The Declaration of Independence of 1776 laid great stress on the basis principles of democracy. For it not only recognised that sovereignty resides in the people, but also stresses the <a id="calibre_link-200" class="calibre10"></a>fact that people organise the government to safeguard their rights.</p>
<p class="indent">The success of the Americans in establishing democracy greatly inspired the French people. Though French had helped the colonists against the British mainly for political purposes, French people indirectly benefited from this participation in the war. French soldiers who had taken part in the war began to feel that if they could help others to win freedom, there was no reason why they could not free themselves from the oppressive rule of their own degenerate and corrupt monarchs.</p>
<p class="indent">The success of the Americans had its impact on England also. The personal rule of George III was done away, and the party system and the cabinet form of government were revived. Hence, the English were once again able to regain their constitutional liberties. Thus, the American Revolution greatly strengthened the idea of the right of revolution, the right of people to overthrow an oppressive government and install a just one in its place.</p>
<p class="indent">The American Revolution is also significant for the fact that it resulted in the creation of the first specimen of a written constitution as in the foundation of the first federation in the world. In 1788, a constitutional convention was held at Philadelphia and the constitution of the USA was drawn up and ratified by it. It proved to be a great success. For not only America follows the same constitution to this day, but many other countries of the world took inspiration from American example and came to have written constitutions.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides, the 13 colonies united together to form a federation. It was the first federal republic in the world, and the adaptation of a federal government was a novel political experiment. The 13 units recognised a central authority (federal government) for common interests, but retained considerable local autonomy. Due to its success, many modern democratic countries, such a Canada, Australia, India, etc., had followed the American example, of course, with the necessary changes.</p>
<p class="indent">The revolution affected England in more than one way. To begin with, it meant a great commercial loss to the British. The 13 colonies served as a market for the finished products of England, and provided different kinds of raw materials for their factories. The loss of the colonies, therefore, proved quite harmful for the commercial and industrial development of England. Secondly, the defeat of the British at the hands of the colonists and the loss of many colonial possessions to the French (West Indies, Senegal, etc.) and the Spanish (Minorca and Florida), apart form that of the 13 colonies gave a severe blow not only to the prestige of England, but also to her actual power and strength.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the revolution necessitated certain changes in the colonial policies and practices of the British. For it clearly exposed the glaring defects of the old colonial policies and practices and thus paved the way for the new colonial policy based on liberalism. The English were now forced to grant more responsible government to their colonies in other countries so that she might not lose them. Thus British colonialism passed from on state to another, i.e., from the mercantile of monopoly stage to free trade stage.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Significance of the Revolution?</b></i></span> The American Revolution was unlike any other in the history of revolutions. It occurred in the empire distinguished above all others in the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century by the large measure of political, religious, and economic freedom it allowed its colonies overseas. Thus, Americans, unlike other revolutionary people, had already experienced some form of freedom. An important reason for the Revolution was the desire for even more than they already had. Like all revolutions, the American one started with small, relatively unimportant demands that grew, during and after the conflict, far beyond <a id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre10"></a>the vision of the original participants. Had the American colonies rebelled had they not been taxed without representation? Or would they have found another issue of discontent? Some historians view the American revolutionaries as clearly intending to make a break with [their] European past. These scholars believe that American Revolution was staged against Europe against monarchy, imperialistic wars, feudalism, colonialism, mercantilism, established Churches, and oppression of the many by the few. In this sense, the United States declared itself independent in 1776 not only of Great Britain but also of Europe. Had it not been for taxation, more grievances are apt to have arisen. The American Revolution was inevitable.</p>
<p class="indent">In many respects, the American Revolution was the first of its kind. USA is one of the very few states in the world that underwent only one revolution. It is also among the small minority of the states, whose revolution, ideologies, and the regime established under it, lasted. There may be many theories of what constitutes a revolution but the simplest one is the definition of revolution. However, a sudden change in the government structure signifies a revolution. The government that ensued in the late 1700s was very different from its Royal English predecessor. The people of America and the people of Great Britain view authority, and thus, government, in distinct terms. This is due to the varied experiences and points of view of the American and English people towards their government. In contrast to the great revolutions that have marked the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the American Revolution succeeded in accomplishing what it set out to do&mdash;to give men more liberty than they had previously possessed.</p>
<p class="indent">While the question of how revolutionary the American Revolution was remains an inherently unresolved issue, there is no doubt that the American experience was a real <a id="calibre_link-202" class="calibre10"></a>revolution. It was a struggle to progress from dependent colonies to independent states, from monarchy to republic, from membership in an extended empire in which several members were connected only through the centre to participation in a single federal nation. And it succeeded.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00063.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How were the State Constitutions Drawn Up?</b></i></span> The success of the Revolution gave Americans the opportunity to give legal form to their ideals as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, and to remedy some of their grievances through state constitutions. As early as May 10, 1776, Congress had passed a resolution advising the colonies to form new governments. Some of them had already done so, and within a year after the Declaration of Independence, all but three had drawn up constitutions.</p>
<p class="indent">The new constitutions showed the impact of democratic ideas. None made any drastic break with the past, since all were built on the solid foundation of colonial experience and English practice. Each was animated by the spirit of republicanism; an ideal that had long been praised by Enlightenment philosophers.</p>
<p class="indent">Naturally, the first objective of the framers of the state constitutions was to secure those “unalienable rights” whose violation had caused former colonies to repudiate their connection with Britain. Thus, each constitution began with a declaration or bill of rights. Virginia, which served as a model for all others, included a declaration of principles, such as popular sovereignty, rotation in office, freedom of elections and an enumeration of fundamental liberties: moderate bail and humane punishment, speedy trial by jury, freedom of the press and of conscience, and the right of the majority to reform or alter the government.</p>
<p class="indent">Other states enlarged the list of liberties to guarantee freedom of speech, of assembly and of petition, and frequently included such provisions as the right to bear arms, to a writ of <i class="calibre8">habeas corpus</i>, to inviolability of domicile and to equal protection under the law. Moreover, all the constitutions paid allegiance to the threebranch structure of government&mdash;executive, legislative and judiciary&mdash;each checked and balanced by the others.</p>
<p class="indent">The state constitutions had some glaring limitations, particularly by more recent standards. Constitutions established to guarantee people their natural rights did not secure for everyone the most fundamental natural right equality. The colonies south of Pennsylvania excluded their slave populations from their inalienable rights as human beings. Women had no political rights. No states went so far as to permit universal male suffrage, and even in those states that permitted all taxpayers to vote (Delaware, North Carolina and Georgia, in addition to Pennsylvania), office-holders were required to own a certain amount of property.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Articles of Confederation?</b></i></span> The struggle with England did much to change colonial attitudes. Local assemblies had rejected the Albany Plan of Union in 1754, refusing to surrender even the smallest part of their autonomy to any other body, even one they themselves had elected. But in the course of the Revolution, mutual aid had proved effective, and the fear of relinquishing individual authority had lessened to a large degree.</p>
<p class="indent">John Dickinson produced the “Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union” in 1776. The Continental Congress adopted them in November 1777, and they went into effect in 1781, having been ratified by all the states. The governmental framework established by the Articles had many weaknesses. The national government lacked the authority to set up tariffs when necessary, to regulate commerce and to levy taxes. It lacked sole control of international relations: a number of states had begun their own negotiations with foreign countries.</p>
<p class="indent">Economic difficulties after the war prompted calls for change. The end of war had a severe <a id="calibre_link-203" class="calibre10"></a>effect on merchants who supplied the armies of both sides and who had lost the advantages deriving from participation in the British mercantile system. The states gave preference to American goods in their tariff policies, but these tariffs were inconsistent, leading to the demand for a stronger central government to implement a uniform policy.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Role of the Constitutional Convention?</b></i></span> George Washington wrote of the period between the Treaty of Paris and the writing of the Constitution that the states were united only by a “rope of sand.” Disputes between Maryland and Virginia over navigation on the Potomac River led to a conference of representatives of five states at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1786. One of the delegates, Alexander Hamilton, convinced his colleagues that commerce was too much bound up with other political and economic questions, and that the situation was too serious to be dealt by an unrepresentative a body.</p>
<p class="indent">He advocated calling upon all the states to appoint representatives for a meeting to be held the following spring in Philadelphia. The Continental Congress was at first indignant over this bold step, but its protests were cut short by the news that Virginia had elected George Washington as a delegate. During the next fall and winter, elections were held in all states but Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="indent">It was a gathering of notables that assembled at the Federal Convention in the Philadelphia State House in May 1787. The state legislatures sent leaders with experience in colonial and state governments, in Congress, on the bench and in the army. George Washington, regarded as the country’s outstanding citizen because of his integrity and his military leadership during the Revolution, was chosen as the presiding officer.</p>
<p class="indent">Prominent among the more active members were two Pennsylvanians: Governor Morris, who clearly saw the need for national government, and Governor James Wilson, who laboured indefatigably for the national idea. Also elected by Pennsylvania was Benjamin Franklin, nearing the end of an extraordinary career of public service and scientific achievement. From Virginia came James Madison, a practical young statesman, a thorough student of politics and history and, according to a colleague, “from a spirit of industry and application... the best-informed man on any point in debate.” Madison today is recognised as the “Father of the Constitution.”</p>
<p class="indent">Massachusetts sent Rufus King and Elbridge Gerry, young men of ability and experience. Roger Sherman, shoemaker turned judge, was one of the representatives from Connecticut. From New York came Alexander Hamilton, who had proposed the meeting. Absent from the Convention were Thomas Jefferson, who was serving in France as minister, and John Adams, serving in the same capacity in Great Britain. Youth predominated among the 55 delegates &ndash; the average age was 42.</p>
<p class="indent">The Convention had been authorised merely to draft amendments to the Articles of Confederation but, as Madison later wrote, the delegates, “with a manly confidence in their country,” simply threw the Articles aside and went ahead with the building of a wholly new form of government.</p>
<p class="indent">They recognised that the paramount need was to reconcile two different powers &ndash; the power of local control, which was already being exercised by the 13 semi- independent states, and the power of a central government. They adopted the principle that the functions and powers of national government, being new, general and inclusive, had to be carefully defined and stated, while all other functions and powers were to be understood as belonging to the states. Realizing that the central government had to have real power, the delegates also generally accepted the fact that the government should be authorised <a id="calibre_link-204" class="calibre10"></a>among other things to coin money, to regulate commerce, to declare war and to make peace.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did the Debates and Compromises Take Place?</b></i></span> The 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century statesmen who met in Philadelphia were adherents of Montesquieu’s concept of the balance of power in politics. This principle was supported by colonial experience and strengthened by the writings of John Locke, with which most of the delegates were familiar. These influences led to the conviction that three equal and coordinate branches of government should be established. Legislative, executive and judicial powers were to be so harmoniously balanced that no one could ever gain control. The delegates agreed that the legislative branch, like the colonial legislatures and the British Parliament, should consist of two houses.</p>
<p class="indent">On these points, there was unanimity within the assembly. But sharp differences arose as to the method of achieving them. Representatives of the small states New Jersey, for instance objected to changes that would reduce their influence in the national government by basing representation upon population rather than upon statehood, as was the case under the Articles of Confederation.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, representatives of large states, like Virginia, argued for proportionate representation. This debate threatened to go on endlessly until Roger Sherman came forward with arguments for representation in proportion to the population of the states in one house of Congress, the House of Representatives, and equal representation in the other, the Senate.</p>
<p class="indent">The alignment of large against small states then dissolved. Almost every succeeding question raised new problems, to be resolved only by new compromises. Northerners wanted slaves counted when determining each state’s tax share, but not in determining the number of seats a state would have in the House of Representatives. According to a compromise reached with little dissent, the House of Representatives would be apportioned according to the number of free inhabitants plus three-fifths of the slaves.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain members, such as Sherman and Elbridge Gerry, feared that the mass of people lacked sufficient wisdom to govern themselves and thus wished no branch of the federal government to be elected directly by the people. Others thought the national government should be given as broad a popular base as possible. Some delegates wished to exclude the growing West from the opportunity of statehood; others championed the equality principle established in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.</p>
<p class="indent">There was no serious difference on such national economic questions as paper money, laws concerning contract obligations or the role of women, who were excluded from politics. But there was a need for balancing sectional economic interests; for settling arguments as to the powers, term and selection of the chief executive; and for solving problems involving the tenure of judges and the kind of courts to be established.</p>
<p class="indent">The Convention finally achieved a draft incorporating in a brief document the organisation of the most complex government yet devised a government supreme within a clearly defined and limited sphere. In conferring powers, the Convention gave the federal government full power to levy taxes, borrow money, establish uniform duties and excise taxes, coin money, fix weights and measures, grant patents and copyrights, set up post offices, and build post roads. The national government also had the power to raise and maintain an army and navy, and to regulate interstate commerce. It was given the management of Indian affairs (affair of aboniginals), foreign policy and war. It could pass laws for naturalising foreigners and controlling public lands, and it could admit new states on a basis of absolute equality with the old. The power to pass all necessary and proper laws for executing these clearly defined powers rendered the federal government able <a id="calibre_link-205" class="calibre10"></a>to meet the needs of later generations and of a greatly expanded body politic.</p>
<p class="indent">The principle of separation of powers had already been given a fair trial in most state constitutions and had proved sound. Accordingly, the Convention set up a governmental system with separate legislative, executive and judiciary branches each checked by the others. Thus congressional enactments were not to become law until approved by the president. The president was to submit the most important of his appointments and all his treaties to the Senate for confirmation. The president, in turn, could be impeached and removed by Congress. The judiciary was to hear all cases arising under federal laws and the Constitution; in effect, the courts were empowered to interpret both fundamental and statute law. Members of the judiciary, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, could also be impeached by Congress.</p>
<p class="indent">To protect the Constitution from hasty alteration, Article V stipulated that amendments to the Constitution be proposed either by two-thirds of both houses of Congress or by two-thirds of the states, meeting in convention. The proposals were to be ratified by one of two methods: either by the legislatures of threefourths of the states, or by convention in three-fourths of the states, with the Congress proposing the method to be used.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the Convention faced the most important problem of all: how should the powers given to the new government be enforced? Under the Articles of Confederation, the national government had possessed &ndash; on paper &ndash; significant powers, which, in practice, had come to naught, for the states paid no attention to them. What was to save the new government from the same fate?</p>
<p class="indent">At the outset, most delegates furnished a single answer - the use of force. But it was quickly seen that the application of force upon the states would destroy the Union. The decision was that the government should not act upon the states but upon the people within the states, and should legislate for and upon all the individual residents of the country. As the keystone of the Constitution, the Convention adopted two brief but highly significant statements:</p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre8">Congress shall have power...to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the...powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States.... (Article I, Section 7)</i></p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre8">This Constitution and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. (Article VI)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Thus the laws of the United States became enforceable in its own national courts, through its own judges and marshals, as well as in the state courts through the state judges and state law officers.</p>
<p class="indent">Debate continues to this day about the motives of those who wrote the Constitution. In 1913, Charles Beard, in <i class="calibre8">An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution</i>, argued that the Founding Fathers stood to gain economic advantages from the stability imposed by a powerful and authoritative national government because they held large amounts of depreciated government securities. However, James Madison, principal drafter of the Constitution, held no bonds, while some opponents of the Constitution held large amounts of bonds and securities. Economic interests influenced the course of the debate, so did state, sectional and ideo-logical interests. Equally important was the idealism of the framers. Products of the Enlightenment, the Founding Fathers designed a government that, they believed, would promote individual liberty and public virtue. The ideals embodied <a id="calibre_link-206" class="calibre10"></a>in the U.S. Constitution are an essential element of the American national identity.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How were Ratification Done and Bill of Rights Passed?</b></i></span> On September 17, 1787, after 16 weeks of deliberation, the finished Constitution was signed by 39 of the 42 delegates present. Franklin, pointing to the half-sun painted in brilliant gold on the back of Washington’s chair, said:</p>
<p class="indent"><i class="calibre8">I have often in the course of the session...looked at that [chair] behind the president, without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting; but now, at length, I have the happiness to know that it is a rising, and not a setting sun.</i></p>
<p class="indent">The Convention was over. Yet a crucial part of the struggle for a more perfect union was yet to be faced. The consent of popularly elected state conventions was still required before the document could become effective.</p>
<p class="indent">The Convention had decided that the Constitution would take effect upon ratification by conventions in nine of the 13 states. By June 1788, the required nine states ratified the Constitution, but the large states of Virginia and New York had not. Most people felt that without the support of these two states, the Constitution would never be honoured. To many, the document seemed full of dangers: would not the strong central government that it established tyrannise them, oppress them with heavy taxes and drag them into wars?</p>
<p class="indent">Differing views on these questions brought into existence two parties, the federalists, who favoured a strong central government, and the anti-federalists, who preferred a loose association of separate states. Impassioned arguments on both sides were voiced by the press, the legislatures and the state conventions.</p>
<p class="indent">In Virginia, the anti-federalists attacked the proposed new government by challenging the opening phrase of the Constitution: “We the People of the United States.” Without using the individual state names in the Constitution, the delegates argued, the states would not retain their separate rights or powers. Virginia anti-federalists were led by Patrick Henry, who became the chief spokesman for back-country farmers who feared the powers of the new central government. Wavering delegates were persuaded by a proposal that the Virginia convention recommend a bill of rights, and anti-federalists joined with the Federalists to ratify the Constitution on June 25.</p>
<p class="indent">In New York, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison pushed for the ratification of the Constitution in a series of essays known as <i class="calibre8">The Federalist Papers</i>. The essays, published in New York newspapers, provided a now-classic argument for a central federal government, with separate executive, legislative and judicial branches that checked and balanced one another. With <i class="calibre8">The Federalist Papers</i> influencing the New York delegates, the Constitution was ratified on July 26.</p>
<p class="indent">Antipathy toward a strong central government was only one concern among those opposed to the Constitution; of equal concern to many was the fear that the Constitution did not protect individual rights and freedoms sufficiently. Virginian George Mason, author of Virginia’s 1776 Declaration of Rights, was one of three delegates to the Constitutional Convention who refused to sign the final document because it did not enumerate individual rights. Together with Patrick Henry, he campaigned vigorously against ratification of the Constitution by Virginia. Indeed, five states, including Massachusetts, ratified the Constitution on the condition that such amendments be added immediately.</p>
<p class="indent">When the first Congress convened in New York City in September 1789, the calls for amendments protecting individual rights were virtually unanimous. Congress quickly adopted 12 such amendments. By December 1791, enough states had ratified 10 amendments to make them part of the Constitution. Collectively, they are known as the <i class="calibre8">Bill of Rights.</i> Among their provisions: freedom of speech, <a id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre10"></a>press, religion, and the right to assemble peacefully, protest and demand changes (First Amendment); protection against unreasonable searches, seizures of property and arrest (Fourth Amendment); due process of law in all criminal cases (Fifth Amendment); right to a fair and speedy trial (Sixth Amendment); protection against cruel and unusual punishment (Eighth Amendment); and provision that the people retain additional rights were not listed in the Constitution (Ninth Amendment).</p>
<p class="indent">Since the adoption of the Bill of Rights, only 16 more amendments have been added to the Constitution. Although a number of the subsequent amendments revised the federal government’s structure and operations, most followed the precedent established by the Bill of Rights and expanded individual rights and freedom.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Hamilton vs. Jefferson Controversy?</b></i></span> The conflict that took shape in the 1790s between the federalists and the anti-federalists exercised a profound impact on American history. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, represented the urban mercantile interests of the seaports; the Antifederalists, led by Thomas Jefferson, spoke for the rural and Southern interests. The debate between the two concerned the power of the central government versus that of the states, with the Federalists favouring the former and the anti-federalists advocating states’ rights.</p>
<p class="indent">Hamilton sought strong central government acting in the interests of commerce and industry. He brought to public life a love of efficiency, order and organisation. In response to the call of the House of Representatives for a plan for the “adequate support of public credit,” he laid down and supported principles not only of the public economy, but of effective government.</p>
<p class="indent">Jefferson advocated a decentralised agrarian republic. He recognised the value of a strong central government in foreign relations, but did not want it strong in other respects. Hamilton’s great aim was more efficient organisation, whereas Jefferson once said “I am not a friend to a very energetic government.” Hamilton feared anarchy and thought in terms of order; Jefferson feared tyranny and thought in terms of freedom.</p>
<p class="indent">The United States needed both influences. It was the country’s good fortune that it had both men and could, in time, fuse and reconcile their philosophies. One clash between them, which occurred shortly after Jefferson took office as secretary of state, led to a new and profoundly important interpretation of the Constitution. When Hamilton introduced his bill to establish a national bank, Jefferson objected.</p>
<p class="indent">Speaking for those who believed in states’ rights, Jefferson argued that the Constitution expressly enumerates all the powers belonging to the federal government and reserves all other powers to the states. Nowhere was it empowered to set up a bank.</p>
<p class="indent">Hamilton contended that because of the mass of necessary detail, a vast body of powers had to be implied by general clauses, and one of these authorised Congress to “make all laws which shall be necessary and proper” for carrying out other powers specifically granted. The Constitution authorised the national government to levy and collect taxes, pay debts and borrow money. A national bank would materially help in performing these functions efficiently. Congress, therefore, was entitled, under its implied powers, to create such a bank. Washington and the Congress accepted Hamilton’s view&mdash;an important precedent for an expansive interpretation of the federal government’s authority.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">The French Revolution (1789&ndash;1795)</b></h3>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">General Survey</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent">The late 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century saw an event of far greater impact on world history than even the English <a id="calibre_link-208" class="calibre10"></a>and American revolutions. This was the French Revolution which looms larger than the earlier two revolutions, for, it brought about greater economic and social change, and influenced a larger portion of the world than the previous upheavals. It marked not only the triumph of the bourgeoisie but also the full awakening of the masses. Middle-class liberalism came to the fore, but so did nationalism with its appeals to people from all sections of society. The most remarkable result of the French Revolution was the role played by ‘the people’. The masses, long suppressed by the elite minority, now strode into the limelight, staking their claim to life, liberty and equality.</p>
<p class="indent">France, the home of Enlightenment, was not ruled by an enlightened despot until the advent of Napoleon. Consequently, France was a country of gross inequality and inefficiency. This lumbering, inefficient government machinery could not run for very long and soon creaked to a standstill, leaving the ambitious and dissatisfied bourgeoisie to make a successful bid for power.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the old regime in France, all French people belonged legally to an ‘estate’ or order of society, and this membership determined their legal rights and privileges. The first estate comprised the clergy, the second estate consisted of the nobility, and the third estate included everyone else&mdash;merchants, artisans and peasants. While the first two estates made up only two per cent of the population, they owned nearly 35 per cent of the land and enjoyed most of benefits of government patronage. They were also exempt from almost all taxes, which, they thought, were beneath their status.</p>
<p class="indent">The third estate, especially the peasants, had to bear the whole burden of taxation. The French peasants accounted for 80 per cent of the population but owned only about 30 per cent of the land. To worsen the injustice, peasants were required to pay a <i class="calibre8">tithe</i> to the Church, an assortment of feudal dues to the nobles, land tax, income tax, poll tax and various other imposts to the state. This was a particularly heavy load for the peasants to bear since the prices of general goods rose by 65 per cent between 1720 and 1789, while the prices of farm goods (the source of peasant income) lagged far behind.</p>
<p class="indent">There was unhappiness among the artisans too because their wages had risen only 22 percent during those same decades. The bourgeoisie, however, were not so badly off in the matter of taxes because they could protect themselves better than the peasants and the artisans. Furthermore, most businessmen profited from the rising prices and the fivefold increase in French trade between 1713 and 1789. Despite this, the middle class was thoroughly dissatisfied with the old aristocratic regime. They resented being snubbed by the nobility, treated as second class subjects by the crown, and excluded from the higher posts in the bureaucracy, Church and army. In short, the bourgeoisie wanted political power and social prestige to match their growing economic importance.</p>
<p class="indent">This was the situation in France when the revolution began. The French Revolution, like others before and after, started moderately and became radical progressively. It began, not in 1789 as a bourgeois revolution, but in 1787 as an aristocratic revolution. It then moved left through the bourgeoisie and mass phases until a reaction occurred that brought Napoleon to power.</p>
<p class="indent">The aristocrats began the revolution because they wanted to regain political power they lost to the crown during the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries. The king’s intendants had replaced the nobility in governance, and the king’s bureaucracy controlled all levels of government throughout the century. It is understandable then that, when Louis XVI found himself in financial trouble after the heavy expense incurred in supporting <a id="calibre_link-209" class="calibre10"></a>the American Revolution, the nobles tried to seize the opportunity to regain power.</p>
<p class="indent">The confrontation began in 1787 when Louis tried to levy uniform tax on all land property regardless of the social status of the holder. The nobility and the clergy branded the new tax illegal and said that only the nation as a whole sitting in the Estates-General could institute such a sweeping change. The king had to give way when the financial crunch became too severe, and he finally summoned a meeting of the Estates-General in the spring of 1789. The privileged classes assumed they would be able to control this body and thereby regain a dominant position in the government. In this regard the nobility were wrong. The meeting of the Estate-General led not to the triumph of the nobility but to the unleashing of a revolutionary wave that was to sweep away established institutions and ruling classes in France and much of Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">The first victory scored by the commoners was in pressuring the king to transform the Estates-General into a national assembly. This was a vital change because the Third Estate would be in a constant minority. But as soon as the representatives of all three estates combined to form a national assembly, the commoners with their allies in the other two camps were able to secure a majority.</p>
<p class="indent">The king began to vacillate on the crucial issue and allowed the three estates to merge only when the commoners openly defied him. However, he continued to head the counsel of royal advisors and dismissed a minister favourable to reform. The rumour also began to spread that the king was preparing to dissolve the assembly by force. It seemed as if nothing could stop the king for he had the bayonets while the commoners in the National Assembly had only words and resolutions. But at this crucial juncture, the commoners in the Assembly were saved by an uprising of the common people of Paris. The masses intervened decisively, initiating the third or mass phase of the Revolution.</p>
<p class="indent">The fall of the Bastille on July 1789 marks the entry of masses on the histori cal stage. Their intervention had saved the bourgeoisie, and the middle class was forced henceforth to rely on the street mobs to supply a crucial dose of revolution at crucial moments. There were to be many such moments in the years to come as the middle class struggled for power against the king, the privileged elite and eventually against the old order in all Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">The Revolution was not confined to Paris alone. The mass revolution occurred in the countryside as well. The peasants took up arms incited by the standing grievances and by the stirring news of the storming of Bastille. Fences were torn down, lands seized and manor houses burnt in many parts of the countryside. Faced with this revolutionary situation, the nobles and clergy in the National Assembly made a virtue of necessity and voted with the commoners to abolish feudalism. Among the important measures decreed by the Assembly was the confiscation of Church lands, the reorganisation of the judicial and administrative systems and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen.</p>
<p class="indent">However, things did not run smoothly. Problems continued with the king unwilling to accept the Declaration and with Austria and Prussia opting for war against France. Under these circumstances, the mob swung into action against the king; and under pressure from the mob, the assembly suspended the king and called for election of a national convention.</p>
<p class="indent">The convention elected by universal manhood franchise met in September 1792 and was extremely successful in meeting its most pressing problem&mdash;the defence of the country against Austrian-Prussian invaders. This combination of revolutionary call and popular support proved irresistible. France emerged victorious in the war with the Austrians and <a id="calibre_link-210" class="calibre10"></a>Prussians. In 1793 Holland, Britain and Spain joined the coalition against France. The revolutionaries responded with their famous “levee on masse” and rose to their country’s defence. Inspired by the revolutionary slogan “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity”, the French armies swept everything before them. By 1795, the enemy coalition was destroyed.</p>
<p class="indent">The National Convention was meanwhile shifting more and more to the left. This was party due to its election by universal franchise and party due to the revolutionary fervour engendered by the war effort. By June 1793, the Girondists on the radical group were displaced by the Jacobins who were even more extreme in their belief in the republic. The dominant organ of the government now was the committee of public safety. With passionate patriotism and great revolutionary zeal, the committee appointed and dismissed generals, spurred the masses to heroic action, conducted foreign policy, legislated and crushed all opposition by means of a ruthless reign of terror. Thousands were charged with treason or insufficient patriotism and were subjected to the guillotine or the ‘national razor’ as it was called.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately the terror soon got out of hand and the revolution began ‘devouring its own children’. One after another, the revolutionary leaders followed Louis and Marie Antoinette to the guillotine&mdash;sacrifices in the unceasing struggle for power. Equally disturbing for the bourgeoisie was the growing social rad icalism of the revolution. The <i class="calibre8">sans-culottes</i> (literally, those who lacked the knee breeches of genteel society) began demanding a more equitable <a id="calibre_link-211" class="calibre10"></a>distribution of land, government regulation of prices and wages and a social security system. These were measures beyond the plans of the bourgeoisie and so like their English counterparts, they worked to halt the leftward course of the revolution. In England, the Levellers were defeated and the rule of Cromwell was established. The outcome in France was the bringing of the <i class="calibre8">sans-culottes</i> under control first by a Directory of five in 1795 and then by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00090.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Europe in 1789</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did the Revolution Take Place?</b></i></span> The discontentment of the unprivileged classes or the Third Estate with their prevailing social-economic conditions was a crucial factor for its outbreak. The members of the Third Estate forming 98 per cent of the total French population had only obligations but no rights at all. Within the Third Estate itself, the peasants were the most numerical.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the degree of agrarian distress was not uniform all through the country, the general picture was far from bright. The trouble came chiefly from three factors, viz. obsolete methods of farming, the shortage of land and over-population. The latest techniques of the agricultural revolution were not in vogue in France before 1789. Vast areas remained uncultivated or kept fallow every second or third year in accordance with medieval practice. The growing population could not find full employment or a decent livelihood. The average holding was so small that even a propertied peasant faced starvation in poor crop years. The position of the landless people was much worse.</p>
<p class="indent">Inflation combined with heavy taxation also oppressed the peasants. The up ward trend of prices in France brought prosperity to many towns throughout the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. To the backward rural economy, it meant the new hardship of inflation. Since the price of farm products rose less swiftly than that of the goods which farmers had to buy, the real income of the peasant shrank. Moreover, they had to pay a number of taxes not only to the State, but also to the Church and nobility. In fact, to the State they owed, apart from the customary land tax, a wide variety of other duties, of which the most widely detested was the “<i class="calibre8">gabelle</i>” (the obligatory purchase of salt from government agents usually at an exorbitant price). All these exactions deprived peasants of four-fifths of the income. In addition, the peasants had an obligation to the government, called the ‘<i class="calibre8">corvee</i>’, i.e., they had to take part in the construction of highways without any remuneration&mdash;a kind of forced labour. So, by 1789, unemployment and poverty had created a revolutionary temper among the peasants.</p>
<p class="indent">Urban workers, another important constituent of the Third Estate, had no reason to like the old regime. Though no class-conscious body of factory workers existed in pre-revolutionary France, almost every sizeable town had its wage earners, employed chiefly in small businesses or workshops. These urban workers were the worst affected by the rising prices. They were not, however, to be the vanguard of the revolution: geographically scattered and lacking in class cohesiveness, they were ready to follow the lead of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p class="indent">The bourgeoisie comprised Frenchmen of disparate resources and interests such as rich merchants and bankers in the cities, store-keepers and lawyers in vil lages and towns, doctors and other professional men, and thousands of craftsmen running their own little businesses. Inexorable hostility to the privileged estates and warm receptiveness to the propaganda of the <i class="calibre8">philosophes</i> were responsible for the emergence of this sprawling middle class as a united political force. Though they were not as unprivileged and unfortunate as the peasants and workers were, they resented the abuses of the old regime even more. Enterprising businessmen complained of guild regulations and other obsolete restrictions <a id="calibre_link-212" class="calibre10"></a>on free commercial activity. They found it galling to be snubbed by the nobility, treated as second-class subjects by the monarchy and excluded from lucrative posts in government, Church and army.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, the privileged class, consisting of the clergy and the nobility and forming just above 2% of the total population in 1789, were enjoying many social and economic privileges without performing their duties and obligations. They neglected the duties on the manors and in monasteries and grew indifferent to the fate of the nation. They collected taxes and dues from the people but paid no taxes to the government. The nobility, in particular, enjoyed the rights of hunting, fishing, etc., in the community lands. They monopolised the high offices in government, Church and army. Even among each of these two privileged classes, there developed two grades, higher and lower. The higher nobility were rich and lived at the court. The lower nobility were no better than the middle class. The lower clergy had to bear the entire burden of the official duties and responsibilities while the higher clergy were enjoying the pleasures of court life. The lower grades, naturally, resented the undeserved privileges of the higher ones and when revolution broke out they did not have any hesitation in joining its ranks.</p>
<p class="indent">Political factors cannot be overlooked. The centralised despotism of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century was slowly weakening due to the succession of weak kings. For want of a bold and efficient mechanic, the machinery of centralised royal absolutism was gradually falling apart. The administration had fallen into the hands of greedy and corrupt nobles who successfully resisted all attempts of Louis XV and Louis XVI at reforms. The ambitious foreign policy of the Bourbons contributed much to the unpopularity of the monarchy in France. Since Richelieu’s time, France was involved in a series of foreign wars which impoverished the nation. The War of Polish Succession ruined the prestige of France, while the intervention of France on behalf of the rebels in the American Revolution did more harm than good to the French monarchy. It opened the gates of France to revolutionary ideas from abroad.</p>
<p class="indent">Above all, the growing discontent in the country was fanned by the <i class="calibre8">philosophes</i>. They gave people a blueprint of a new society based upon a new philosophy of life. Voltaire, for instance, wanted men to break off from traditions and practice religious tolerance. Rousseau popularised the ideas of people’s sovereignty, civil freedom, social equality and rights of men. His “<i class="calibre8">Social Contract</i>” became the Bible of the French Revolution. Montesquieu, on his part, advocated the establishment of a democratic government on the principle of separation of powers. The whole intellectual movement crystallised into three watchwords, viz., Liberty, Equality and Fraternity which electrified the whole society. Thus, though the French Revolution was the outcome of realities, it cannot be denied that without the help of enlightenment it could not have arisen.</p>
<p class="indent">The immediate cause of the Revolution was financial. Growing deficit, blown up by the expense of French aid to the American Revolution, drove the monarchy steadily towards bankruptcy. Louis XVI tried one expedient after another without much success and finally summoned the Estates-General, the central French rep resentative assembly that had last met 175 years earlier. Once assembled, the rep resentatives of the nation initiated reforms that were to destroy the old regime in France.</p>
<p class="indent">To sum up, the peasants did not want so much as change in the form of gov ernment. They most emphatically wanted more land, if need be at the expense of the clergy and the nobility. They wanted an end to manorial dues, and finally, they wanted relief from an oppressive system of taxation. The urban workers, on their part, wanted to improve their economic condition. The bourgeoisie, fully aware of their own growing economic importance, wanted social and political rights to match. Because they were wealthier, better educated, and more articulate than the peasants and urban workers, they took the leading role in formulating the grievances of the entire Third Estate. These grievances were compiled in statements called “<i class="calibre8">cahiers</i>” and submitted to the Estates-General in 1789. These <i class="calibre8">cahiers</i>, therefore, reflect the aims of the French Revolution to a great extent. They pronounced the freedom of the press as the stoutest rampart against abuses and the surest means of maintaining freedom of the nation; demanded reforms in criminal laws; recommended contact between the sovereign and his people to safeguard personal freedom of all citizens; proposed that all Frenchman have the right and the hope of securing any state office, and all military and ecclesiastical dignities; demanded the replacement of existing taxes by levies on all property without distinction as to owners; and finally asserted the sanctity of private property. It is very clear that <i class="calibre8">cahiers</i> were aimed to give effect to Adam Smith’s <i class="calibre8">Wealth of Nations</i>, to Jeremy Bentham’s <i class="calibre8">Principles of Legislation</i> and to Rousseau’s <i class="calibre8">Social Contract</i>. In other words, the aim of the bourgeoisie was to put an end to the old political, economic and social order and to usher in a new order based on Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Take Place?</b></i></span> The course of the Revolution can be seen in two periods, from 1789 to 1791 when France was ruled by the National Assembly, and from 1792 to 1795 when France was ruled by the National Convention. To begin with, the National Assembly introduced drastic reforms which sought to guarantee individual liberty, social equality and democratic nationalism. One such reform was the total abolition of feudalism. Henceforth, taxes were to be paid by all in proportion to their revenues, and all public expenses were to be borne equally by all. In addition, the clergy gave up its <i class="calibre8">tithes</i>, and the nobility surrendered its medieval rights. The Assembly made it a clean sweep by abolishing serfdom, forbidding the sale of justice or of judicial office, and throwing open the ecclesiastical, civil and military posts and dignities to all. It, thus, abolished feudalism with all its oppressive institutions. The National Assembly then made the Declaration of the Rights of Man which mirrored the political and economic attitudes of the bourgeoisie. It incorporated the key phrases of the philosophers&mdash;natural rights, general will, and separation of powers. Thus, the National Assembly reaffirmed the ideals of Enlightenment. Yet, as the subsequent history of the revolution soon demonstrated, the Assembly found no magic formula by which to implement these ideals.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-214" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00128.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Revolutionary Paris</p>
<p class="indent">The economic legislation of the National Assembly provided a case in point. The new and just land tax imposed by the Assembly simply could not be collected. Tax collectors had vanished in the general liquidation of the old regime, and the peasants were naive enough to think that they owed nothing to a government turned revolutionary. Once again, the French state borrowed until its credit was exhausted, and then, in desperation, the Assembly ordered the confiscation of Church lands explaining that ecclesiastical lands fell outside the bounds of “inviolable” property <a id="calibre_link-215" class="calibre10"></a>as defined in the Declaration of the Rights of Man because they belong to an institution and not to private individuals. The government, thus, ac quired an asset worth at least two billion lire. On the basis of this collateral, it issued “<i class="calibre8">assignats</i>”(paper notes used to pay the government’s debts). The <i class="calibre8">assignats</i> had adequate security behind them and temporarily eased the financial crisis. Un fortunately, the Revolution did not know when to stop. As the state sold parcels of confiscated land, i.e., as it reduced the collateral securing its paper money, it should have destroyed <i class="calibre8">assignats</i> to the same amount. The temptation not to reduce the number of <i class="calibre8">assignats</i> proved too great to resist. Consequently, inflation set in. The <i class="calibre8">assignats</i>, progressively losing their solid backing, depreciated until in 1795, they were worth less than 5% of their face value.</p>
<p class="indent">This economic experiment resulted in the redistribution of some of the best farmland in France. Many peasants, mainly rich, enlarged their holdings by buying former ecclesiastical property; the poor and landless peasants gained nothing, since they did not have the money to buy. Following the doctrine of <i class="calibre8">laissez-faire</i>, the National Assembly made no move to help the marginal farmer. But it abolished the guilds and the irksome internal tariffs and tolls in order to benefit the bourgeoisie. Deeming the few primitive organisations of labour unnatural restraints on economic freedom, it abolished them too. In June, 1791, following an outbreak of strikes, it passed a law banning both strikes and labour unions.</p>
<p class="indent">Another major measure of the Assembly was passing the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790). Since the suspension of the <i class="calibre8">tithes</i> and the seizure of the ecclesiastical property deprived the Church of its revenues, the Assembly agreed to finance ecclesiastical salaries. The new arrangement virtually nationalised the Gallican Church and made it subject to constant government regulation. It transformed bishops and priests into civil officials, paid by the state and elected by the population of the diocese or parish. A new bishop was required to take an oath of loyalty to the state. These provisions stripped the Pope of his effective authority over the Gallican clergy and ran counter to the tradition of the Roman Church as an independent ecclesiastical monarchy. Naturally, the Pope denounced the civil constitution. The National Assembly, after vain attempts at compromise, demanded that every member of the French clergy take a special oath supporting the civil constitution, but only a few complied. Good Catholics, from Louis XVI down to humble peasants, rallied to the non-juring clergy, those who refused the special oath. The civil constitution of the clergy was, thus, the first great blunder of the Revolution.</p>
<p class="indent">Next important step of the Assembly was its effort to put limited monarchy on a permanent footing, culminating in the Constitution of 1791. It devised a neat and orderly system of local government to replace the bewildering complex of provincial units. It divided the territory of France into 83 departments of approximately equal size. The departments were sub-divided into <i class="calibre8">arrondisements</i> or districts, and the districts into communes or municipalities. At each stage, elected councils and officials enjoyed considerable rights of self-government. Separation of powers was the guiding principle of reconstruction of the central government. The new constitution, while establishing an independent hierarchy of courts staffed by elected judges, vested legislative authority in a single elected chamber. In foreign policy, revolutionary France was to be more virtuous and less aggressive than autocratic France.</p>
<p class="indent">The new constitution was no doubt a great step in instituting popular government, but it stopped well short of full democracy. It divided French men into two classes of citizens, active and passive. It limited the right of voting to <a id="calibre_link-216" class="calibre10"></a>active citizens, who paid annually in taxes an amount equal to at least three days wages for labour in the locality. The passive citizens enjoyed full protection of the law but did not receive franchise. Moreover, the new legislature was chosen by a process of indirect election, in which the electors, chosen by ordinary active citizens, were required to be men of substantial wealth. Thus, the French middle class assumed, to their own advantage, that a certain amount of worldly goods was necessary for political wisdom.</p>
<p class="indent">The limited monarchy established by this constitution was, however, doomed to fail. It was too radical to suit the king and most of the aristocracy, and not radical enough for the good number of bourgeois who were veering toward republicanism. Majority in the assembly supporting the constitution suffered the fate commonly experienced by the politically moderate in a revolution. The middle-of-the roaders were squeezed out by the extremists known as the Jacobins. The latter were no true friends of the Constitution of 1791. They accepted it only as a stop-gap arrangement.</p>
<p class="indent">On the morning of 10<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> August 1792, the forces of the new Paris Commune stormed the royal palace. Though Louis XVI and the royal family found temporary safety with the newly elected legislative Assembly, August 10 events sounded the death-knell of monarchy. With most of the deputies of the Right (Constitutional Monarchists) and the Centre (Neutralists) absent, the Assembly, under the influence of the Left (Republicans), voted to suspend the king from office, to imprison the royal family, and to order the election of a constitutional convention.</p>
<p class="indent">The Revolution was carried further by the National Convention (1792&ndash;95). One of the most important acts of the Convention was the abolition of monarchy and the establishment of the first French Republic. Louis XVI was found guilty of treason and sentenced to the guillotine without delay. The Convention duly voted a democratic constitution (1793), granting universal manhood suffrage, and giving supermen power to a single legislative chamber. Due to the outbreak of the war with other European nations, the Convention postponed the operation of this Constitution of 1793 indefinitely, which always remained a dead letter.</p>
<p class="indent">When the Convention by the Edict of Fraternity, announced the readiness of the French to help people who wanted to overthrow the old regime in their countries, all the monarchies of Europe, taking it as an open challenge, declared war on France. The Prussian and Austrian rulers had already joined against France. The execution of Louis XVI and the growing violence in France excited public opinion in England against the Revolution. Therefore, the open aggressive attitude of the French drove Great Britain, Holland, Spain, Austria, Prussia and Sardinia into a coalition.</p>
<p class="indent">The Convention was faced at home with a more serious situation. Many of the provinces or departments rose against the Republic. Hence the Convention had to take serious steps against the internal and external enemies. A Committee of Public Safety, a kind of War Cabinet, and a Revolutionary Tribunal were set up, and real power passed into their hands. All those who were suspected of royalist tendencies were sent to the guillotine. Thus commenced the Reign of Terror, which became more terrible due to the factional fights among the Radicals.</p>
<p class="indent">In the midst of foreign war and internal dissension, the Convention made a sig nificant contribution not only to France but also to the whole of Europe. To begin with, the war-time hysteria inspired to a remarkable degree the feeling of Nation alism. In August 1793, the Convention decreed that during the war all Frenchmen, old and young, married and unmarried, are requisitioned for the services of the armies. The Committee of Public Safety promptly put these principles into oper ation. The army drafted all bachelors and widowers <a id="calibre_link-217" class="calibre10"></a>from 18 to 25. Hundreds of open air forges were installed in Paris to manufacture weapons. With this massive mobilisation, forces of the Republic succeeded in driving foreign troops off the French soil by the end of 1793.</p>
<p class="indent">The Convention’s economic measures are equally significant. Total mobilisation required an approximate, if not absolute, equality of economic sacrifices. To tackle the twin problems of inflation and food shortage, the Convention issued maximum legislation, placing ceilings on prices and wages. Wages were fixed at a point 50% over the 1790 wage rate and prices at 33% above the 1790 price level. The government rationed scarce commodities, forbade the use of white flour, and directed all patriots to eat “equality bread”, a loaf utilising almost the whole of the wheat. Finally early in 1794, the Convention passed the “Laws of Ventose” named after a month in the revolutionary calendar. These laws permitted the seizure of the remaining properties of the émigrés and other opponents of the Republic in order to distribute them among the landless Frenchmen.</p>
<p class="indent">The Convention during the Reign of Terror presented its most revolutionary aspect in its drastic social and cultural reforms. The Republic of virtue could tolerate nothing that smacked of the old Regime. The traditional forms of address, Monsieur and Madame, gave way to the newly orthodox Citoyen (Citizen) and Citoyenne. Ever since 1789, revolutionaries had discarded gowns and knee breeches as symbols of idleness and privilege. Good republican men were attired in the long baggy trousers of the humble peasant or workman. Women wore simple high waisted dresses, copied from the costumes of the ancient Romans. Rome became the model for behaviour to the virtuous of the Republic, of course, not the sordid Empire. Cabinet-makers, deserting the graceful style of Louis XVI, produced sturdy neo-classical furniture decorated with Roman symbols; playwrights, authors and editors who failed to ornament freedom properly, experienced censorship or even the guillotine. The many lively newspapers of the early revolution were reduced to a few dull semi-official organs.</p>
<p class="indent">The sweeping reform of the Calendar was a high in this meddling. September 22, 1792, the first day of the Republic, was designated as the initial day of year 1. Roman numerals were used for the year, and the traditional mythological names of the months were abandoned. Each month had 30 days, divided into 3 weeks of 10 days. Every 10<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> day was set aside for rest and for celebration of one of the vir tues so cherished by the Republicans. The new Calendar, for all its sanctimonious touches, was a worthy product of the Enlightenment. Yet, it naturally antagonised workmen, who disliked labouring 9 days out of 10, instead of 6 out of 7. It never really took root and Napoleon scrapped it a decade later.</p>
<p class="indent">The Convention had much better luck with another reform close to the spirit of the Age of Reason&mdash;the metric system. A special committee devised new weights and measures based on the uniform use of the decimal system rather than on confused and illogical custom. In August 1793, a decree made metre the standard unit of length, and supplementary legislation in 1795 established litre as the measure of volume and gram as the unit of weight.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the force of tradition proved too strong for the Convention. Nowhere was this more evident than in the attempts to legislate a new religion. Many churches of the old religion were forcibly closed and turned into barracks or administrative offices and their medieval glass and sculpture were destroyed. The Convention decreed in May 1794 that the French people recognise the existence of the Supreme Being and immortality of the soul. But the deistic concept of the Supreme Being was too artificial and remote to appeal to the religious emotions of French men.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-218" class="calibre10"></a>The last great act of the Convention was the passage of the Constitution of 1795. The leaders of the Convention wanted both to remain Republic and to ensure the dominance of the propertied classes. The Constitution of 1795, therefore, denied right to vote to the poorest quarter of the nation and required that candidates for public office possess a considerable amount of property. It established a two-house legislature: a lower council of 500, and an upper council of elders, both to be elected piecemeal after the American practice of renewing one-third of the Senate every two years. Since age and marriage were thought to provide further guarantees of political stability, members of the lower council were required to be at least 30 years old and elders to be 40 and either married or widowed. The council of 500 nominated, and the elders chose, five directors who headed the executive. Otherwise the Directory was almost independent of the legislative councils.</p>
<p class="indent">This Constitution of 1795 marked the third great effort of the Revolution to provide France with an enduring government. It followed in part the American precedent of 1787, in part the French precedent of 1791 and above all precepts of Montesquieu. It embodied the separation of powers and deferred to the aristocracy of wealth though not to that of birth.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were its Achivements?</b></i></span> To begin with, feudalism was abolished in France. With this, feudal institutions all over Europe began to be rocked and it did not take them much time to disappear altogether. The annulment of feudal privileges was followed by the establishment of equality and liberty not only in France but also in the whole of Europe. Social equality came to be recognised and individual freedom was held most precious.</p>
<p class="indent">Political power changed hands from nobility to bourgeoisie. Due to the French example, political power shifted from aristocracy to industrial middle class in England also with the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832. The example of the middle class was followed by peasants and workers who began to fight for franchise not only in France but all over Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">The Revolution shook the hold of the Church over people. For the first time in the history of Europe, social life was made independent of priestly authority. Reason, but not faith, and philosophy but not theology, became the guides in all social and political activities. These developments opened a new and bright chapter in the history of religious toleration.</p>
<p class="indent">More importantly, individuals now came to be treated as an end in himself and life as the greatest of values. Consequently, there was all round interest and desire to promote the material and moral well-being of people. Many humanitarian movements were started with this object. The Methodist movement in England, the movements for the abolition of slavery, for the prohibition of child labour and reform of prisons all over the world did much in that direction.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the Revolution gave a great boost to Constitutionalism which had already begun in Great Britain and the USA. The French Revolution discredited the doctrine of Divine Right of Kings and established sovereignty. The so-called benevolent despotism also failed to satisfy the demands of the enlightened people of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. People realised that the interest of the king and those of the nation were not necessarily the same. Therefore, the idea that the entire nation should take part in the government, which should be the expression of national will, was firmly established. This tremendous intellectual stir manifested itself in a series of constitutional experiments and wrested constitutions which guaranteed the rights and liberties of the individual.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were its Failures?</b></i></span> What the French Revolution achieved was enormous, but what it did not achieve was no less so. For a long time, historians have shown how this <a id="calibre_link-219" class="calibre10"></a>Revolution, bourgeois in its principles and in its social impulses, did not improve the peasants lot. Though this vast, but confused mass of outcastes were excluded from real benefits of the Revolution, they did make themselves heard at least, brandishing their pitchforks. There were others, however, who did not have even that opportunity. Today they might be called the ‘minorities’. Three of them were clearly identifiable during the revolutionary epoch&mdash;Jews, Blacks and women.</p>
<p class="indent">At the dawn of the Revolution, the Jews, living in France, were not French citizens. There were about 35,000 of them, divided into two very different communities. The Sephardics, who came from Spain after the expulsion of the Jews by the staunch Catholic kings in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, had settled either in Southwest France, or in the states belonging to the papacy. The other group, which was much larger in number, was the Ashkenazis who settled in Alsace and Lorraine along the German border. Curiously, the Sephardic Jews &ndash; and they alone, not the Ashkenazis &ndash; were among those who first elected the Estates-General in 1789, which marked the legal beginning of the Revolution.</p>
<p class="indent">For three full days in December 1789, the Constituent Assembly discussed the statute concerning the Jews. Here was proof that the problem existed, was well un derstood and was ripe for resolution. But the discussion ended abruptly. in January 1790, citizenship was granted to the Sephardic Jews, but not to the Ashkenazis who were undoubtedly the much larger group. On this point, traditional Catholic and Royalist law joined together with the radical Jacobins of the extreme left; the two camps united in common principle&mdash;the foreignness of this community which have not integrated linguistically. Finally in September 1791, the decree of the emancipation of French Jews was adopted. Anti-semitism as a mentality was, of course, far from being eradicated (as one saw during the Nazi occupation), but the judicial principle at least had been accepted.</p>
<p class="indent">The question of the Blacks was to have a more terrible fate. In 1788 itself, the So ciety of Friends of Blacks, with La Fayette, Condorcet, Mirabeau among its members, was founded. Thanks to an ardent propaganda campaign, they were able to fill 40 petition books, demanding the abolition of slavery. But was all this translated into action? Despite the abolition of slavery (late and fugitive though it was), the French planters in the colonies, the traders in the ports, the big merchants in the slave trade, would not let it put into practice. They managed to corrupt some of the greatest names of the Revolution. Then in 1791, a violent insurrection led by the black leader, Toussaint Lauverture, broke out in Saint Domingue, which put an end to these ardent abolitionist desires.</p>
<p class="indent">Who, in France, has heard of the “Code Noir” (the Black Code)? Promulgated in 1685 under Louis XIV, this notorious text regulated the fate of slaves in the French colonies. During the Revolution, not a word was said about the Code Noir neither by Montesquieu nor by Rousseau, even though it was available in bookshops. In 1794, slavery was abolished, but not Code Noir. In 1802 when France was back in its territories in the West Indies, the Code Noir was still there. It was not until 1848, and the work of Victor Schoelcher (The French politician who fought for abolition of slavery) for slavery to finally disappear not only in principle but in spirit and practice.</p>
<p class="indent">What about the status of women? The guillotine was a great devourer of feminine heads, beginning with that of the queen. Madame Roland, the Gerondin, who mounted the scaffold crying, “Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name!” is no less famous. Others have been a bit too well forgotten, those great fiery heroines of the Revolution who have been so carefully and deliberately excluded by the male revolutionaries.</p>
<p class="indent">Very little was, in fact, done for women’s rights during the Revolution, compared to <a id="calibre_link-220" class="calibre10"></a>what they wanted. During the 1870 Commune women again took active part, but it was not until the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century that the question of women’s rights began to be tackled. The strong patriarchal aspect of the French Revolution, its absolute male domination, prevented it from perceiving the injustices it did to the women, all of them reduced to the same level of animality, emotionalism and stupidity as it was said of the Blacks.</p>
<p class="indent">The Jews were the first to the liberated (1791); the Blacks knew how to revolt (1848). Women, who defined themselves as a “black continent” drawing inspiration from the revolts of the Negroes, had to wait till the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century to liberate themselves. Even then, their struggle was not yet over.</p>
<p class="indent">As a modern historian of the French Revolution said, the Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789 had its audacities but also its limits. The Revolution was a Revolution of Anticipations; it certainly anticipated the decree of 1794 on the abolition of slavery; it anticipated that the emancipation of women would battle its way with much difficulty, but, it is only logical that an event that caused such an upheaval of the established order would have its blind spots.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Happen in France First?</b></i></span> The reason why France was the first country on the continent of Europe to do away with the survivals of feudalism was not that the French people were oppressed above all others. Much has been written on the misery of the French peasants of the period. Carlyle in his picturesque way has said that one-third of them had nothing but third-rate potatoes to eat for one-third of the year. However, two shrewd observers, Arthur Young (English) and Thomas Jefferson (American), who travelled in France just prior to the revolution, were somewhat differently impressed. Young, for instance, admitted that the government of France was “the mildest government of any considerable country in Europe, our own excepted”. Jefferson, expecting to find physical discomfort and misery among the peasants, found a degree of prosperity and contentment which amazed him. He certainly gave an impression of people who have reached a state of desperation that they can bear their burdens no longer. Undoubtedly, the French peasants had various inconveniences and restrictions to endure, which might easily develop into flagrant abuses. The last relics of serfdom, for instance, had not yet disappeared from their lives. With all these things, French peasants were much better than the peasants of Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy or Spain.</p>
<p class="indent">The real reason was that the French people were sufficiently enlightened to realise the evils and absurdities of the system of government under which they suffered. The writings of Voltaire and Encyclopaedists had been widely read and their teachings accepted with enthusiasm, so that there was a general disposition to regard kings and lords as oppressors who had no real right to the tyrannical powers which they claimed. Thus in the case of France, as in the case of Russia later, we have a strong and determined minority imposing their will upon a majority who had been oppressed for centuries, and who were therefore in the best mood to accept changes which might improve and which, they believed, could hardly make worse their material conditions. They apprehended nothing but ultimate good for the forcible destruction of systems which exalted dynastic interests at the expense of the general interests of the community.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Napoleonic Era (1795&ndash;1815)</b></h3>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">General Survey</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent">Napoleon won fame as a brilliantly successful general in Italy and used his reputation and popularity to overthrow the Directory. He governed France as First Counsel from 1799 to 1804 and as Emperor from 1804 to 1814. Two features of his 15 years rule of France <a id="calibre_link-221" class="calibre10"></a>are noteworthy for our purpose&mdash;his domestic reforms&mdash;which consolidated the gains of the revolution and his military campaigns, which provoked a nationalist reaction in neighbouring countries and eventually brought about his downfall.</p>
<p class="indent">So far as domestic policies are concerned, Napoleon may be compared to the enlightened despots. He was interested in technical efficiency rather than abstract ideas. He ruled the country autocratically but efficiently. He codified the laws, centralised the administration, organised a system of national education, established the Bank of France, and reached an agreement with the Papacy concerning Churchstate relations in France. These solid achievements of Napoleon made him popular. There were diehards who hankered for the restoration of the old regime or who thought that Napoleon had betrayed the revolution. The majority hailed him for ending the disturbance and instituting an honest and energetic government.</p>
<p class="indent">Napoleon squandered this goodwill by waging war unceasingly. Since he was a military genius, he was fabulously successful. By 1810, he reached the height of his fortunes. He extended Frances’ frontiers across the Rhine to Lubeck and across the Alps to Rome. The rest of Europe consisted of dependent satellites or allies. Britain alone remained independent and implacably hostile.</p>
<p class="indent">In all his conquered territories, Napoleon put into practice some of the basic principles of the French Revolution. He abolished feudalism and serfdom, recognised equality of all citizens, and instituted his famous law codes. These innovations disturbed and alienated vested interests everywhere, but there was also widespread support for them in many quarters. The bourgeoisie and many intellectuals responded favourably to them, but it was foreign rule and that, where necessary, it was imposed by force. Napoleon’s non- French subjects eventually grew tired of the requisitioning, the taxes, the conscription, and the wars and rumours of wars. French rule usually meant a higher quality of administration, but the time came when people were more impressed by the Frenchness of the administration than by its quality.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, people had become nationalistic, and their nationalism had developed as a movement of resistance against Napoleon’s domination. This explains the unrest in Italy, the armed resistance in Spain, and the growing national unity in Germany. Most fatal for Napoleon was the bitter resistance of Russians of all classes when he invaded that country in 1812. Resistance, as much as ice and snow, was responsible for the catastrophic destruction of his Grand Army. From the frozen plains of Russia, the course of Napoleon’s career ended precipitously and inevitably on the island of Elba. Thus the ideology of the French Revolution backfired upon its originators. The people Napoleon had offended were people who had first been awakened and enthused by the slogan Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. They had turned against their teacher when the very principles he had espoused were betrayed by him.</p>
<p class="indent">The Congress of Vienna, which met from September 1814 to June 1815 to redraw the map of Europe after Napoleon’s downfall, was guided by three principles, viz., legitimacy, containment and compensation. By the principle of legitimacy, the monarchs of France, Spain, Holland and Italy were resorted to their thrones. By the principle of containment, the states bordering France were made as strong as possible. Holland was given Belgium; Austria received Lombardy and Venetia, and Prussia received lands along the Rhine as well as part of Saxony. The victorious allies compensated themselves by taking various territories-Norway went to Sweden; Malta, Ceylon and the Cape of Good Hope to Britain; Finland, Bessarabia and most of Poland to Russia, and Dalmatia and Galicia to Austria.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-222" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Reasons for Napoleon’s Rise to Power?</b></i></span> The execution of Robespierre in July, 1974 marked the end of the swing of political pendulum in France towards the left. The Directory marked the beginning of a swing back to the right, which culminated in the Napoleonic Empire. The Directory (1795&ndash;99) was a bourgeois government, established with the undeclared aim of preventing the return of either monarchy or anarchy. Two conditions made short work of the Directory: the mediocre individuals in charge of government and the threat of invasion of French territory by foreign powers. Once the revolutionary wave subsided, people desired security, workers wanted employment and a living wage, farmers wanted land and end of disorder, businessmen wanted peace, and militarists wanted war. The Directory tried in vain to satisfy all these interests. In the midst of outbreaks, a royalist and conservative uprising occurred in Paris in October 1795, which was put down by government troops commanded by young Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
<p class="indent">Financial troubles offered incalculable difficulties. Shortage of income and mounting indebtedness furnished an instant nightmare. The Directory desired peace, but the annexation of Belgian provinces (1795) made war with England inevitable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did he Rise to Power?</b></i></span> Although he took no active part in the revolution, through the influence of Barras (one of the Directors), Napoleon became influential in the government. He was extremely popular with the people because of his military victories and, at the age of 26, was given command of an Italian expedition, which he led successfully. He then induced the Directors to equip an expedition to be sent to Egypt, with the aim of crippling English commerce. From a military point of view, the expedition was a failure, but Napoleon managed to return to France, leaving his army behind him. He blamed the Directory for his failure and called for the abolition of the government. The people willingly gave their consent. A new government was formed, with General Bonaparte as the First Consul, and a thinly veiled dictatorship was established.</p>
<p class="indent">The government of the Consulate was a fragile system which gave Napoleon an opportunity to do as he pleased under the guise of constitutionality. The Constitution, drawn up with the aid of the legislative commission and the sieyes, was ratified by the French with only 1,500 dissenting votes. Napoleon, as First Consul, presided over the most important body, called the Council of States. Local government officials were appointed by him. This centralised the power to a greater degree than had been the case under the Bourbons. Napoleon soon dismissed the routine matter of reorganising the government and turned to his profession of a soldier.</p>
<p class="indent">Austria was humiliated and compelled to surrender at Luneville. Napoleon negotiated a treaty with England (Amiens 1802). For the first time in 109 years, Europe was at peace. He took advantage of peace to carry out the much needed reforms. He consolidated his power at home, bringing under his control the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the government. Law, education, public works and, above all, the army were developed under his guidance. An imperialist at heart, Napoleon planned a great colonial empire. The Louisiana territory west of the Mississippi river in America was acquired in 1800. He gained control of Haiti, and he sent agents to the Far East and India to draw up plans for military conquest. Every one of these projects failed. In 1803, Napoleon sold Louisiana to the USA and began the task of subduing Europe. One of his first steps in this direction was to make himself Emperor of France (1804). Boastfully, he announced, “I found the crown of France on the ground and I picked it up with my sword”.</p>
<p class="indent">He tried to revive the dignity of the old empire. Rules of etiquette, similar to those in force before the revolution, were established: titles, honours and pensions were restored, and members of the Bonaparte family were raised to the rank of royalty. This last act aroused the ire of European royalty, partly because they feared Napoleon and partly because they considered it an insult to hereditary royalty.</p>

<p class="caption">Napoleon’s Empire</p>
<p class="indent">Napoleon recognised England as his most formidable opponent. He conquered continental european powers, but England remained invincible. Russians, Prussians and Austrians fell before his well-directed military campaigns. He tried unsuccessfully to cripple England by blockading continental ports. Unfortunately, his control over Europe finally dwindled. He could conquer kings and inefficient armies, but when people began to rebel against him he was helpless. He was defeated in Russia in 1812, and the Allies closed in on France.</p>
<p class="indent">England, in alliance with Austria, Russia and Prussia declared war on Napoleon, and they defeated him in the Battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of Nations in 1813. Napoleon was forced to abdicate and was sent into exile on the island of Elba, a few miles off the Italian coast in 1814. However, escaping after a few months, he returned to France on 1<sup class="calibre13">st</sup> March 1815 and for a “Hundred Days” he subjected Europe to turmoil. At Waterloo, on 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> June 1815, he received a crushing blow and this time under the supervision of the English, he was sent to St. Helena in the Atlantic. Here <a id="calibre_link-224" class="calibre10"></a>he spent his final days, dreaming and writing his memoirs and breathed his last on 5<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> March 1821.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did he Fail?</b></i></span> The Napoleonic system had too many shortcomings. Typical of dictatorships, it depended too much on one man. The whole system centred on him, but the innumerable tasks of the empire were beyond the control of even a superhuman. Napoleon’s system was militaristic, and warfare and conquest cannot be continued indefinitely. While the French people soon lost their enthusiasm, the opposing forces were able to strengthen their resistance gradually. Moreover, Napoleon wore himself out. As early as 1812, the year of his first important military reverses, his health was beginning to fail. Napoleon had taught Europe the art of warfare; repeated reverses led opponents to adopt his tactics. At the close of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> Century, the armies of most of the European countries were poorly trained, inadequately equipped, and unintelligently generaled. In 1814, Napoleon faced welltrained armies led by outstanding generals such as the Duke of Wellington, who had been trained in the school of bitter defeat at his very hands.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00036.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Napoleon Bonaparte</p>
<p class="indent">Napoleon subjugated several countries and his empire was based on force. The people of the conquered countries had no say, whatsoever, in their own administration. He did away with their rulers without much fanfare and placed his own relatives on the thrones of these territories. He deprived them of their freedom, personal as well as national. All these acts hurt their national self-respect and pride, and hence they began to hate foreign rule. Thus, his unjust and tyrannical rule awakened the feeling of nationalism in the conquered territories and inspired them to rise against Napoleon and put an end to his power.</p>
<p class="indent">The English navy was much superior to that of the French. Lord Nelson inflicted a crushing defeat on Napoleon and smashed his naval power. Napoleon organised a large army to invade England, but the British navy and the English Channel stood in his way. Besides, England was the most industrialised and the richest country of Europe at that time. As a result, England was able to organise four coalitions, one after another, against France with the help of European countries. She helped them with men, money and materials and ultimately succeeded in defeating Napoleon.</p>
<p class="indent">Napoleon was wise enough to realise that England was his main obstacle. However, in the absence of a powerful navy, he could not overcome it. However, he knew that England’s trade was the source of her strength, and so in order to ruin her trade, he introduced the “continental system”. It was his greatest blunder and ultimately it proved to be his undoing. He could not enforce this system for the same old reason, viz., lack of powerful navy. He compelled the subjugated states to accept it; in the process ruining their trade and commerce. It led to inflation and added to the sufferings of the people of Europe. Consequently, the Continental countries began to defy this system, and that hastened his decline. It had been rightly remarked: “The continental system of Napoleon was the principal tragedy in the drama of his fall”.</p>
<p class="indent">Napoleon for instance, wanted to enforce the Continental System in Spain and Portugal. When they refused to oblige him, napoleon declared war against them. He forced the king of Spain to abdicate and installed his brother on the throne of Spain. Such a policy led to a great national upsurge in Spain against Napoleon. Consequently, he was involved in the Peninsular War for a long time and it proved <a id="calibre_link-225" class="calibre10"></a>suicidal for him. Napoleon himself once said: “It was the Spanish ulcer that ruined me”.</p>
<p class="indent">Since Russia also rejected the Continental System due to economic reasons, Napoleon invaded her with a large army in 1812. Instead of fighting, the Czar adopted the strategy of retreating and destroying crops, villages and towns so that the enemy might not take advantage of them. Consequently, thousands of French soldiers were killed by hunger, exhaustion, severe winter, rain and snow. Napoleon was thus forced to retreat. The Moscow campaign also proved suicidal and, in fact, was one of the major causes of his downfall.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Impact?</b></i></span> Napoleon preserved and popularised several of the important theories and ideals of the French Revolution. He spread the ideas of the revolution wherever his armies conquered. While he saw the dangers of doing this, he also saw the advantages that it gave him over his foes, not realising that in the end it would mean his own downfall. He recognised distinction not of class but of meritorious service regardless of birth or religion. Though he was tyrannical, he always emphasised the fact that he ruled by the express will of the people. Every advancement of his power in France was submitted to the people for their affirmation before the final step was taken. If Napoleon, or someone equally capable, had not assumed leadership in France when he did, the French Revolution might have been stamped out by the autocratic powers with the complete suppression of its ideals in France as in Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">Modern nationalism got an impetus during the Napoleonic period. In fact, Napoleon’s rise to power was itself partly due to this growing spirit. It also accounted for the impassioned support that the French people gave him after his rise to power and, ironically, its spread among other people was responsible for his defeat. Old governments took a new lease on life and new ones were founded on the firm foundation of nationalism. Napoleon carried the nationalistic spirit into Germany and Italy where no unity had existed before his arrival. England, Spain, Austria and to a lesser degree Russia were united in spirit and motive because Napoleon threatened their very existence.</p>
<p class="indent">Napoleonic era witnessed many important changes in the polity. A new regime, for instance, was introduced. In contrast to the ancient regime, the new government was based on the doctrine of popular sovereignty and was supported by a national army. It introduced a national school system and a parliament that represented the citizen body instead of the classes. General acceptance of these principles was not immediate but progress in their direction had been steady.</p>
<p class="indent">The legal reforms contained in the “Code Napoleon” were the most constructive of the Napoleonic era. France had been for a long time in need of a new system of law&mdash;one that would be uniform and definite. Napoleon completed the task of codifying the laws. A civil code; a code of civil procedure, a code of criminal procedure, a penal code and a commercial code were completed. He preserved, not only for France but also for much of Europe and part of America, the chief fruits of the revolution, viz., civil liberty, religious tolerance, emancipation of serfs, and trial by jury. A woman’s position was made inferior to that of a man and harsh punishments were tolerated. In spite of these defects, Code Napoleon ranks with Justinian Code as one of the greatest legal documents in history. Its significance is well brought out by Napoleon himself when he said: “My real glory is not having won 40 battles. What will never be effaced, what will endure for ever is my Civil Code”.</p>
<p class="indent">Napoleon strove to find a solution to the religious strife in France. The French Revolution suppressed the Church and confiscated its property. But Napoleon saw the value of <a id="calibre_link-226" class="calibre10"></a>the Church. “If there had not been a Roman Catholic Church, I would have had to create one”, he remarked. By a concord in 1801, the Pope agreed to consent to the confiscation of Church property in France and to have the clergy paid by the state while Napoleon agreed that bishops should be invested with spiritual power and symbols of their office by the Pope and that the priests should be appointed by the bishops with the approval of the government. Besides, though Catholicism was recognised as the religion of majority of Frenchmen, they were not forced to confirm with it unless they personally desired to do so. Similar favours were accorded to Protestant Churches and to Jewish synagogues. This was a long step towards official religious toleration.</p>
<p class="indent">Financial difficulties had been responsible for most of the political changes in France before Napoleon came to power. This condition he had to remedy and, at the same time, raise enough money to finance his expensive wars. To begin with, he was able to win the confidence of the prosperous middle class. Moreover, he encouraged trade and industrial expansion by offering prizes for mechanical inventions. Noticeable industrial progress had been made till 1812. A national bank was created in 1800, taxation was adjusted so that the burden was placed on those best able to pay, and national debt was stabilised. Napoleon was merciless in the punishment of those guilty of corruption and was careful to maintain an efficient and economic fiscal system. The plan worked very well, until the Empire began to collapse. Faced with defeat, he had to resort to indirect taxes. However, many of his reforms were continued by the subsequent governments.</p>
<p class="indent">A number of public works were undertaken regardless of the almost incessant warfare. Napoleon took great interest in the beautification of the cities as well as in the construction of great projects to promote economic activity. More than one billion francs were spent on public works between 1804 and 1813. The famous city of Paris, with its wide, tree-lined boulevards, its monuments and fine buildings, bears testimony to his contribution. He laid military roads across France to Belgium and to the Rhine and across the Alps into Switzerland. He built bridges, of which, the Austerlitz and the Jena across the Seine are most famous. Napoleon himself planned the Bourse (stock exchange) and the Church of Madeleine in Paris.</p>
<p class="indent">The field of education did not escape his attention. He sought to discipline the minds and consciences of the French. He believed that an educational process was the only certain way of bringing people around to his way of thinking. “Good methods make good minds, good principles make good citizens” and this he believed could be accomplished only through a rigidly controlled state system of schools. Napoleon was keen to remove Church influence on the schools. “The recall of the Jesuits, I will not permit”, he declared. To him, education was to be used for political ends; not for free thinking, but for glorification of principle. The Imperial University was established in 1808. It was not a university in the general sense, but an entire system of education, including everything from elementary schools to institutions of higher learning. Fidelity to the Emperor was the basis of all instruction. The educational system established by Napoleon, obviously, was not the ideal type. Yet, two important things in educational progress were accomplished: state-sponsored schools were opened to all citizens, and the principles of lay education were perpetuated.</p>
<p class="indent">Napoleon’s service to Europe and the world were, thus, in no way less important than his services to France. His empire in Europe did not last long, but it had far reaching effects on France as well as on many countries of Europe. He swept away the old regime and old institutions and practices from the conquered <a id="calibre_link-227" class="calibre10"></a>territories. He established new political order and organised society on the principle of equality. He carried the revolutionary ideals to other countries of Europe. He put an end to feudalism, serfdom and class distinction in these countries. The Code Napoleon was recognised not only in France but in other countries of Europe as well. Even these days, this code is prevalent in France and with some modifications in Italy, Holland, Belgium and Germany. When the French soldiers went to fight in other European countries, they carried with them the revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity and laid the foundation of nationalism there. Finally, the credit of paving the way of unification of Italy and Germany, to some extent, goes to Napoleon. Thus, it may not be improper on our part to agree with Hayes who says, “Thanks to the events of the Napoleonic Era, the revolution, which originally had been French, was becoming European”.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Controversy about Napoleon?</b></i></span> Few individuals in history have inspired such passionate debate as Napoleon. In part, this controversy is a result of his meteoric rise to the heights of power and his string of military conquests. In part, it is a consequence of the charismatic quality of his leadership. He combined personal dynamism and charm, which created faith in masses of followers and enabled him to dominate many with whom he came into contact. The debate is also related to difficulties separating the myth of Napoleon from the reality of Napoleon. Finally, all sides of the debate can find some support in the varied, contradictory legacy of Napoleon’s intentions and deeds. Therefore, it is not surprising that historians have bitterly disagreed over how to characterise Napoleon.</p>
<p class="indent">Many historians argue that Napoleon was fundamentally a dictator. They point to the methods he used to acquire power&mdash;the fame associated with military prowess, the coup <i class="calibre8">d’etat</i>, and the plebiscite that seemed to affirm democratically his power without offering a real choice&mdash;as methods typical of modern dictators. They also point to his actions after acquiring power&mdash;crowning himself emperor, eliminating freedom of speech and press, removing the substance from representative institutions, initiating a systematic crackdown on political opponents, and creating a secret police &mdash; as characteristic of military dictatorships. Other historians, see him as a preserver of the revolution. They stress his familiarity with Enlightenment ideas and his early support of the French Revolution. They point out that Napoleon did affirm the end of feudalism, the overthrow of old aristocracy, establishment of equality before the law for men, and the rights of property. They also argue that his most important service may have been in spreading the ideas and institutions of the revolution beyond France’s borders &mdash; in particular, the rejection of aristocratic privilege and the spread of the Napoleonic Code. In short, Napoleon affirmed the fundamental reforms of the early French Revolution, institutionalised them, and then helped spread them elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">Still other historians argue that Napoleon is best viewed as the last in a line of 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century enlightened despots. They point out that like other enlightened despots, such as Frederick the Great of Prussia and Joseph II of Austria, Napoleon was most interested in maximising political and military power of the state. Like them, he saw that to do so required centralising and rationalising the government, improving finances, codifying laws, and supporting the armed forces.</p>
<p class="indent">He shared their tendency to make religious concerns secondary to political unity and to gain support through the creation of educational institutions. Thus from an 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century perspective, Napoleon is recognisable as an enlightened despot.</p>
<p class="indent">Many historians argue that individual leaders themselves, even as extraordinary as Napoleon, do not decisively affect history’s mainstream. <a id="calibre_link-228" class="calibre10"></a>More important are the forces, circumstances, and people that surround them. Other historians maintain that individuals, above all, rare charismatic leaders such as Napoleon, can have significant historical consequences.</p>
<p class="indent">Which of these interpretations best fits the historical record depends greatly on the perspective of the viewer and on what aspects of Napoleon’s personality and rule are emphasised. At the same time, how much can be attributed to the actions of any historical figure must be kept in mind in deciding exactly the role of Napoleon.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Importance of Congress of Vienna?</b></i></span> The overthrow of Napoleon in 1815 brought an end, in Europe at least, to the heroic and tumultuous epoch that had begun in 1789 with the meeting of the Estates General. The intervening 26 years had been filled with great expectation, experimentation, turmoil, and war. Now there was disillusionment and weariness. The European royalty and aristocracy, at long last triumphant over revolutionary France, were determined to put an end not only to the Mirabeaus, Robespierres, and Napoleons but also to the ideas of the Enlightenment.</p>
<p class="indent">The returning holders of power &ndash; monarchs, aristocrats, established Christian Churches, and the elite of the governmental and military bureaucracies &ndash; generally subscribed to a conservatism that was dominant between 1815 and 1830 and that would remain a powerful force throughout the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Conservatives tended to believe that a hierarchical Christian <a id="calibre_link-229" class="calibre10"></a>society authoritatively guided by traditional monarchs, aristocrats, and clergy was time tested and best.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00064.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Congress of Vienna, 1815</p>
<p class="indent">Edmund Burke (1729&ndash;1797), Great Britain’s most influential conservative thinker, and conservatives, in general, rejected the abstract rationalism of the Enlightenment and reforms of the French Revolution. Any rapid change was suspect, and the attempt by the middle class to grasp political power was a presumptuous act by individuals who simply did not know how to rule. For conservatives, the experience of the French Revolution was a lesson in what to avoid.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to achieve their conservative goals, to redraw territorial boundaries and to establish lasting stability in Europe, the leaders of the victorious powers gathered at the Austrian capital of Vienna in the autumn of 1814. To this conference, representatives flocked of every state in Europe, hundreds of dispossessed princes, agents of every conceivable interest, and adventurers.</p>
<p class="indent">The Congress of Vienna was dominated by four major victors over Napoleon. Great Britain was represented by her able foreign minister, Lord Castlereagh. Prussia’s mediocre king, Frederick William III, headed his own delegation, as did Russia’s tsar, the idealistic young Alexander I. Austria’s emperor, Francis I, played host to the assembled great. However, the real leader of the Austrian delegation &ndash; and, indeed, the dominant figure of the whole congress &ndash; was the Austrian chancellor, Prince Klemens von Metternich. As guiding principles on which to base their decisions, the conferees decided on “legitimacy” and “stability.” By <i class="calibre8">legitimacy,</i> they meant that in the redistribution of various territories, attention would be paid not to the desires or interests of the people concerned but to the claims of the victorious &ndash; former and future sovereigns. By <i class="calibre8">stability</i> they meant establishing and maintaining a balance of power within Europe, with particular focus on restraining France. Many of the decisions formalised at Vienna had already been made by the four major powers shortly before and after Napoleon’s overthrow in April 1814.</p>
<p class="indent">Thanks of the clever and able Talleyrand, France, the cause of all the turmoil, got off lightly. Prussia would have severely punished and weakened France, but her three major colleagues were fearful of up-setting the balance of power. Already saddled with the restored Bourbons, France was merely reduced to almost the same boundaries it had before the wars of the revolutionary era. The Congress of Vienna had originally imposed no indemnity on France. However, due to Napoleon’s return from Elba in the midst of the congress and his hundred-day fling that ended at Waterloo, the four great powers compelled France to cede the Saar Basin to Prussia, to pay an indemnity of 700 million francs, and to return the art treasures stolen by Napoleon from various galleries of Europe. Allied forces were to occupy France until the indemnity was paid. To contain France within its frontiers and to discourage future French aggression, Prussia was given a sizable block of territory along the Rhine, the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium) was annexed to the Dutch Netherlands, and Piedmont was enlarged by the annexation of the city-state of Genoa.</p>
<p class="indent">The main powers, taking advantage of political changes that had occurred over the previous 26 years and trading among themselves, received new territories. Great Britain gained several strategic islands and colonies, increasing her sea power and overseas dominance. Prussia added some areas in central Europe that made it more homogeneously German and Western. However, the Rhineland territory was not contiguous to the Prussian homeland&mdash;a situation that invited further aggression. Russia’s acquisition of Polish territory made the great majority of the Polish-speaking people subjects of Russia and <a id="calibre_link-230" class="calibre10"></a>brought Russia farther into the heart of central Europe. Austria, in exchange for the Belgian Netherlands, took the two rich Italian provinces of Lombardy and Venetia. Its pre-eminence in Italy, together with the presidency over the German confederation, made Austria the dominant power in Central Europe. The Holy Roman Empire, which Napoleon had destroyed, was not restored, but in its place the weak German confederation under the permanent presidency of Austria was erected. Napoleon’s consolidation of the more than 300 German states into 39 was allowed to stand, bringing the German people much more political unity.</p>
<p class="indent">The Congress of Vienna has been both admired and criticised by observers ever since 1815. Critics point out that people and territories of Europe were moved about by the great powers at Vienna like pawns on a chessboard, in complete disregard for the wishes of the people or for the spirit of nationalism that was now an increasingly virile force. Instead of trying to deal constructively with the budding forces of liberalism and nationalism, the great powers tried to ignore or repress them. Admirers point out that the Vienna settlement was not vindictive toward France and did establish a reasonable balance of power, both of which contributed to a century of freedom from European-wide war. While one may not agree with the conservative goals of the conferees, a settlement was achieved at Vienna and at least temporarily maintained in succeeding years.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-26"><b class="calibre9">AMERICAN CIVIL WAR (1861&ndash;65)</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the ultimate sense, the roots of American Civil War lie in the rivalry between the agricultural slave-owning South and industrial, non-slave North. The immediate cause was the attempt by Lincoln to maintain an isolated Federal garrison at Fort Sumter in South Carolina despite the decision of South Carolina and other six Southern states to secede from the American Union rather than accept a President nominated by an anti-slavery party. Troops representing the Confederacy fired on Fort Sumter (April 12, 1861) and Lincoln called for volunteers to suppress the insurrection. Four more border states in the South seceded. Military operations began in June 1861. The union had all the advantages; an organised government, twice the man power of the South, command of the seas and industry; but not until the twin defeats of Vicksburg and Gettysburg in July 1863 did the confederates begin to falter. Throughout 1861 and 1862, Jackson and Lee of the Confederacy proved themselves superior commanders, but the emergence of Grant and Sherman as Union Generals and the cumulative effect of naval blockade wore down the Confederates. With the Southern Armies divided and weakened by mass desertions, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox on April 9, 1865.</p>
<p class="indent">There were some 6.2 lakh deaths on both sides. Since Lincoln had emancipated the slaves on January 1, 1863, defeat of the Confederacy meant a social revolution for the South. After Lincoln’s assassination (April 14, 1865), the defeated states were politically exploited by a group of “radical Republicans” who treated South as conquered territory. By their unscrupulous exercise of one-party rule, enforced by military authority, they perpetuated the bitterness between North and South. This period of Black Reconstruction continued until the withdrawal of the last Federal troops from Louisiana and South Carolina in April 1877.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Averican Civil War?</b></i></span> It was the struggle between the 23 Northern states (the Union) and 11 Southern states that broke away from the Union and were organised into the Confederate States of America. In the South, the Civil War was often referred to as the War between the States. But it was called the War of the Rebellion and the War of Secession in the North.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-231" class="calibre10"></a>The firing on Fort Sumter in April 1861 was the climax of a sectional divide that had been broadening for decades. Robert Lee’s surrender to general Ulysses S. Grant in April 1865 brought the war to an end. It left behind a trail of hostility which extended even after the period of Reconstruction and the re-entry of the rebellious states into the Union.</p>
<p class="indent">Both in terms of lives and money, the war proved to be a costly affair. After the war, the South lay in waste. It also provided an example for the victory of a strong federal government over the champions of states’ rights, enabled the abolition of slavery, and gave an impetus to American industrial development.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Take Place?</b></i></span> The main characteristic of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century America was the sectional discord which was prevalent ever since the birth of the republic and which finally led to the civil war. The discord revolved around the economic antagonism between the Northern and Southern states till 1845, and thereafter slavery transcended all other issues and precipitated the war.</p>
<p class="indent">Ever since the birth of the Republic, the North and the South evolved different economic interests which resulted in the political conflicts. The root of the rift was that the South was primarily agricultural and the North was becoming increasingly industrial. It was a struggle between plantation economy and rising individual capitalist economy first making itself manifest on the issue of tariff.</p>
<p class="indent">The South was in favour of only a nominal tariff for revenue purpose and was opposed to federal expenditure on internal improvements, to a centralised banking and to the growth of big industrial corporations. The North, being a centre of capitalist industry and finance, preferred a protective tariff, federal aid in the development of transactions and a banking system controlled by the North Eastern Creditor’s interest, and looked forward to the organisation of the whole national economy by big corporations which they controlled.</p>
<p class="indent">Southern agriculture, based on cotton and slavery, needed fresh lands for rapid expansion. The Northern manufacturers, on the other hand, desired a more concentrated property and, hence, were against smaller and restricted sales at higher prices.</p>
<p class="indent">The system that was resented most by the South was a costly system through which it purchased her manufacturing commodities. There was hardly any direct trade between the South and Europe. A large percentage of Southern cotton was shipped to New York and from there to Europe. The European finished goods and other imports were first brought to the Northern ports and later distributed in the South through the coastal trade. This Cotton triangle caused resentment among the Southerners since it made South to incur higher transaction costs and resulted in extra income to the middlemen of the North.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the economic causes, social and moral issues were responsible for the civil war. Among them the institution of slavery, having economic undertones, was undoubtedly the most crucial one. While majority of the Southerners held that slavery was a positive practise that needed the full protection of the federal government, a good number of Northerners argued that it was an evil and a national disgrace.</p>
<p class="indent">The polarisation of attitude towards slavery did not become serious till the rise of the abolitionist movements. Societies for its abolition had been growing in number since 1815. Northerners began to attack slavery in militant terms insisting that it was contrary to both Christian and American ideals. New England, especially Boston, was one of the nucleuses of this movement. Some of them refused to participate in ordinary political activity under the constitution on the ground <a id="calibre_link-232" class="calibre10"></a>that by associating with the Southern states the North would become sinful. The fugitive slaves received full support from the Northern states and it became a major complaint of Southerners who demanded the intervention of the federal government. According to them, the Abolitionist movement was an unnecessary interference with South’s peculiar institution. Slave owners became furious at being branded as criminals and failed to grasp that only a small number of Northerners supported the Abolitionists. Even more important cause for Southern fury was their fear that abolitionist propaganda might reach the slaves and result in their uprising.</p>
<p class="indent">Since 1848, the main issue of discord between the North and the South was whether slavery should be allowed to permeate to new territories. From the 1830s, with Westward expansion, exodus of agriculture towards the West and creation of the market for agrarian produce in industrialising North, there had been a close link in relations between the North, the South and the West. Due to growing communications and better transport links with the North, the Western Southerners openly voiced their dislike for the expanding slave system against their successful family labour system and supported the North in newly occupied territories in the West.</p>
<p class="indent">With the new territories (viz. New Mexico, Utah, California and Oregon) joining the Union in 1848, North and South clashed on the issue that whether the new territories should be salvestates or freestanding. A compromise in 1850 by Henry Clay was formulated, which admitted California as a free-state and also provided for a severe slave act. In rest of the areas, it was suggested that territorial government be set up without any restrictions on slavery. The compromise did not solve the problem. It simply postponed the imminent crisis.</p>
<p class="indent">The peace that followed the compromise of 1850 disappeared in 1854, when Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Abolishing the earlier acts and leaving the question of slavery in those territories to be decided by the inhabitants, this Act aroused passions. A guerrilla war followed in Kansas with grave offences perpetuated by both pro-slave “border ruffians’ and anti-slave Northern supported fanatics. Thus, by the 1850s, the issues which drifted North and South from each other had become emotionalised.</p>
<p class="indent">By 1860, the lower South (consisting of the seven states of South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas) was determined to break away from the Union, if a Black Republican (meaning a Republican candidate supporting abolitionist movement) was elected President. The return of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Presidential elections was the last straw for the lower South to split the Union.</p>
<p class="indent">South Carolina issued an ‘ordinance of secession’ and prepared for war. The other six states of the lower South quickly followed her, and a convention met at Montgomery in Alabama, elected Jefferson Davis as the President of the ‘Confederate States of America’ and adopted a constitution openly supporting the institution of ‘Negro slavery’.</p>
<p class="indent">The lower South was shortly joined by the upper South (consisting of the four states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas), thus taking the total figure of the rebellious states to 11.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Take Place?</b></i></span> It was fought by improvised armies whose numbers increased steadily from a few thousands to hundreds of thousands, until at last the Federal forces crossed one million mark. The battle ground was a great mass of land between New Mexico and the Eastern Sea. Washington and Richmond were the main targets.</p>
<p class="indent">The Confederates, outnumbered and much less endowed in resources, fought under a general of supreme ability, General Lee. But the general ship of the Union was far inferior. Generals were frequently replaced until finally under Generals Sherman and Grant victory came over the exhausted and ruined South.</p>

<p class="caption">Expansion of the USA in the 19th Century</p>
<p class="indent">In October 1864, a federal army led by Sherman penetrated the Confederate left and charged from Tennessee through Georgia to the coast, right across the Confederate country, and then passing through the Carolinas, came from behind the Confederate armies. Meanwhile, Grant engaged Lee at Richmond until Sherman surrounded him. On 9<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> April 1865, Lee and his men laid down arms, and within a month all the remaining secessionist armies had capitulated and the confederacy came to on end.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Outcome?</b></i></span> Having similar background and nurtured in similar political, social and economic institutions, the North and the South reacted in like manner to the crisis of the civil war. With almost identical governments, the Union and the Confederacy each had to consider as to how far it could respect civil liberties for dissenters and rights for states.</p>
<p class="indent">Both sides suffered heavy causalities. Federal armies suffered about 6.35 lakh causalities, out of which the break up was 3.6 lakh dead and 2.65 lakh wounded. Confederate forces suffered 4.83 lakh causalities&mdash;2.58 lakh dead and 2.25 lakh wounded, and many particularly in the South, suffered material loss also.</p>
<p class="indent">Scarcity of manpower led the North as well as the South to utilise Negroes and, consequently, moved towards the gradual rooting out of slavery.</p>
<p class="indent">In spite of the marked economic difference between the North and the South, both sides issued paper money to meet obligations; both initially bought supplies in Europe and converted existing industrial facilities and developed new ones to meet emergency demands.</p>

<p class="caption">Outbreak of the War</p>
<p class="indent">Although identical problems prompted identical solutions, South was less adept at executing these solutions than the North. South’s attachment to a traditional society, states’ rights, slavery and agrarianism hindered its capacity to change its political, social and economic structure sufficiently to meet the exigency.</p>
<p class="indent">The civil war clearly relegated the rights of states behind the rights of the nation, did away with slavery, smashed the South’s economic and political power, organised Northern industry, and left a trail of animosity and intolerance.</p>
<p class="indent">Sacrifice and victory in a righteous cause saved the North from past and future failures, and left it alive to Southern failure to integrate, but unmindful to the ghettos of Chicago or New York.</p>
<p class="indent">Defeat gave South an explanation for failure, an excuse for inaction, and an unity it had never experienced before. It was outpowered but not convinced, defeated but still defiant, and determined to salvage as much of its caste society as possible. Its lost cause gave South, a greater resolve to maintain its ideas, institutions, and way of life.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Significance?</b></i></span> Some people consider it as the last of the old-fashioned wars, while others have regarded it the first in the modern wars of history. In reality, it was a traditional war, and it had great technological impact on the advancement of modern weapons and techniques. There were many novelties. The war had several firsts to its credit. It was the first one in history in which ironclad warships clashed and the telegraph and railroad played important roles; to use rifled ordinance and shell guns on large scale and to introduce machine gun: to have widespread newspaper coverage, voting by servicemen in national elections and photographic recording; to organise medical <a id="calibre_link-235" class="calibre10"></a>care of troops systematically to use land and water mines and to employ a submarine that could sink widely employed aerial reconnaissance (by means of balloons).</p>
<p class="indent">The civil war has been written about as has been no other war in history. The vast amount of literature on the war (50,000 books and articles) proves the accuracy of Walt Whitman’s prediction that “a great literature will arise out of the era of those four years”. The incidents of the war left a rich heritage for posterity, and that legacy was summed up by martyred Lincoln as showing that the reunited sections of the United States comprised “the least best hope of earth.”</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Lincoln’s Role in it and Abolition of Slavery?</b></i></span> Abraham Lincoln (1809&ndash;1865) was the best specimen of the new people that had emerged after the American War of Independence. During his years, he was constantly on the move at the time of the westward flow of the population. His school was uninspiring and irregular, but his mother taught him to read early, and he became a voracious reader. In 1834, at the young age of 25, he became a member of the House of Representatives for the State of Illinois. In Illinois especially, the question of slavery was strongly discussed, because the great leader of the party for the extension of slavery in the national Congress was Senator Douglas. For several, years Lincoln and Douglas were engaged in serious debates. Their struggle reached its climax in the presidential campaign of 1860, and on 4<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> March 1861, Lincoln was inaugurated President with the lower Southern states already in active secession from the Union.</p>
<p class="indent">Lincoln proved himself to be a better war leader than Jefferson Davis (President of the Confederation). His leadership qualities outweighed those of his opponent. He was practical, flexible, humble, magnanimous, able to take criticism, willing to admit mistakes, humorous, relaxed and tactful. He filled up his cabinet with outstanding, strong-minded political leaders, many of whom were even candidates for presidency and for control of the Republican Party. Lincoln’s personality made it possible for him not only to get along with them but also to utilise their invaluable services. Though he rarely consulted his cabinet members on major policy decisions, he gave them significant autonomy within their departments.</p>
<p class="indent">Even amidst confusion, Lincoln was clear-headed. He stood for the Union and for the prevalence of tranquillity in America. He was against slavery, but slavery was not the dominant issue for him. His primary concern was that USA should not be torn into two opposing and warring segments. This is evident from his public letter in 1862 in which he says, “If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that”. When, in the beginning of the war, Congress and Federal generals were all set to carry out the emancipation of the slaves, Lincoln stalled the hasty action. He was for emancipation by the states themselves with full compensation. It was only in January 1865, that the conditions seemed suitable for the Congress to propose abolition of slavery forever by a constitutional amendment, and by the time this amendment was ratified by the states, the war was already over.</p>
<p class="indent">As Commander-in-Chief, Lincoln took active interest in military affairs, and his judgment was often better than those of his generals. In pursuit of victory, Lincoln appointed and dismissed many generals and once even ordered an offensive to begin. Nevertheless, Lincoln recognised his own limitations and appointed successively Winfield Scott, George McClellan, Henry Hallect, and Ulysses S. Grant to positions of overall command. When he finally found <a id="calibre_link-236" class="calibre10"></a>the right commander, he wrote to Grant: “The particulars of your plans, I neither know nor seek to know.”</p>
<p class="indent">He held the USA together through long tiring months of setbacks and futile efforts, through dark phases of division and failing courage, and there is no instance when he ever wavered from his purpose. He finally saw the Union victorious. He entered Richmond (Capital of the Confederacy) the day after its surrender. He returned to Washington on 11<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> April, 1865 and made his last public address. His theme was reconciliation and reconstruction of loyal government in the vanquished states. On the evening of 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> April, when he was seeing a play in a Washington theatre, he was assassinated by an actor, named Booth, who had some grievance against him. Lincoln’s goal was accomplished; the Union was intact.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-27"><b class="calibre9">ENGLISH REVOLUTION AND DEMOCRATIC POLITICS PARLIAMENTARY REFORMERS, FREE TRADERS &amp; CHARTISTS</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Democracy began to develop in England during the reign of Henry II (1154&ndash;89), great grandson of William, the Conqueror. But rights of the people were first recognised in the Magna Carta (Great Charter) which King John was forced to sign in 1215. John, son of Henry II, has succeeded his brother, Richard, the Lion-Hearted, to the throne. John’s nobles accused him of violating their feudal rights and in 1215, forced him to sign the Magna Carta. It guaranteed nobles that new taxes would not be imposed without the approval of a Great Council, the forerunner of Parliament.</p>
<p class="indent">The Magna Carta, written to protect nobles’ rights, was extended, in time, to include all Englishmen. The Great Council was expanded under King Edward I in 1295 to include middle-class citizens. At first, the nobles and middle-class members of the Great Council met together but later divided into two houses of today’s Parliament &ndash; the House of Lords and the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="indent">The Tudor Dynasty, begun by Henry VII, ruled England for 118 years, from 1485 to 1603, following Henry’s victory in the War of Roses. Henry VII’s son, Henry VIII kept England’s Parliament firmly under his control but allowed it to meet and discuss his policies.</p>
<p class="indent">The next Tudor Edward VI (Henry VIII’s only son) added to the power of the Crown. Henry’s daughter, Queen Mary I, followed and ruled for five years. Her persecution of Protestants caused her to be called Bloody Mary. Elizabeth I, Mary’s half-sister, became queen in 1558. Her 45-year rule laid the foundation for the British Empire. All these Tudor rulers acquired the position of absolute monarchs, and the Parliament was at best playing a second fiddle to the Crown.</p>
<p class="indent">James I established the Stuart family line of English kings. James was a strong believer in the divine right of kings. His rule (1603&ndash;1625) was torn by many disagreements with Parliament in which English middleclass citizens had gained importance during the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. By long custom, Parliament had little used right to refuse to raise new monies for the king. When Parliament refused money asked by James I, he dismissed them. The issue of control over the money would decide who would be England’s real ruler&ndash;King or Parliament.</p>
<p class="indent">Charles I succeeded his father, James I, as English King in 1625. Long standing disagreements continued between the king and Parliament, which opposed his desire for absolute rule, as it had opposed his father. When he needed money in 1628 to pay the expenses of sending naval forces to help the Huguenots in France, Parliament forced him to sign a Petition of Right. The petition bound the king not to set taxes without Parliament’s consent. Disagreements with Parliament continued, and, in 1629, the king dismissed the Parliament. For the next 11 years, Charles <a id="calibre_link-237" class="calibre10"></a>had enough tax money to rule without calling Parliament into session. He made too many enemies as England’s ruler before he was overthrown in a civil war. In need of money to maintain his policies, he was again forced to call Parliament back into session in 1640. It was called the Long Parliament, because it stayed in session for 20 years. Before it granted money, he was forced to agree to several reforms, such as calling Parliament to session every three years. Arguments continued, and many Londoners took up arms in defense of Parliament. Charles raised an army of followers called Cavaliers, who were mostly nobles and large landholders. On the other hand Puritans, small landholders, and middle class citizens rallied behind Parliament. They were called ‘Roundheads’, because they cut their hair short to show their dislike of the Cavaliers, who wore their hair long. The fighting, which began in 1642, came to be known as Puritan Revolution. The Roundheads were led by Oliver Cromwell. As the King’s army grew weaker, Cromwell’s grew stronger. When the king finally surrendered in 1646, the civil war ended. They could not reach a satisfactory peace settlement because members of Parliament did not want to deal too severely with their ruler. After two years of disagreement, Cromwell took control of Parliament with the help of his army and appointed a special court to try Charles I on charges of treason. The court found him guilty, and he was beheaded in 1649.</p>
<p class="indent">England’s monarchy was abolished by Parliament after Charles I’s execution. England was declared a Commonwealth and free state, without any king or House of Lords. Oliver Cromwell took control as a military dictator until a new form of government could be established. The House of Commons was made up of middleclass citizens who could not agree on a new type of government. The army and royalists had their own ideas of setting up a government. In 1653, Cromwell dismissed two Parliaments when they could not agree on a new form of government. A constitution, drawn up by the army, gave Cromwell control as Protector of England, although much power was to be given to Parliament. It became England’s first and only written constitution. His administration was strong, successful, but not always popular. Although offered the Crown, Cromwell refused to be the king. Cromwell enforced strict Puritan rules against all amusements. The Puritan rule of England ended soon after Cromwell’s death in 1658.</p>
<p class="indent">Many Englishmen wanted a return to the days of kings. Parliament invited the son of Charles I to return from exile in France. He returned to England and was crowned King Charles II in 1660. His 25 year reign was called the ‘Restoration’ because it brought back royalty and pre-Puritan amusements to England. He too had troubles over politics and religion. Political parties formed during Charles II’s reign. The Whig party, mostly middle-class, supported Parliament. The Tory party, representing the upper class, supported the king. When Charles II died in 1685 without leaving a son, his brother James was opposed by the Whigs because he was a Catholic. But the Tories had him crowned as James II.</p>
<p class="indent">James II aroused opposition after assuming the English throne. He angered Parliament with his efforts to revive the king’s divine right. Both Tories and Whigs were further alarmed by his support of Catholicism. Hence, plans were made to overthrow James II. Tories and Whigs joined in secretly offering the British throne to James’ older daughter, Mary, who was married to William III of Orange (the ruler of Holland).</p>
<p class="indent">William and Mary accepted the offer and landed in England in November 1688 with a large army. When James’ army did not support him, he fled to France. William and Mary became rulers of England. The overthrow of the king and installation of a successor was called England’s Glorious Revolution or Bloodless Revolution.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-238" class="calibre10"></a>Parliament adopted measures to uphold its right to select kings who would obey English laws. In 1689, a Bill of Rights was passed that prohibited the king from cancelling laws, levying taxes, or maintaining an army without Parliament’s consent. In addition, the king could not interfere with election for seats in Parliament. The people were guaranteed the right to petition the government and the right to protection against unjust fines and excessive bails and punishments. The main effect of the Glorious Revolution was to make England a democratic nation, with a royal ruler.</p>
<p class="indent">Democracy progressed in England despite the pressures of wars. George I’s reign (1714&ndash;1727) saw great increases in Parliament’s powers. When Queen Anne died, leaving no children, the crown of England went to the next heir, George, although he was a German prince. He was the first of the Hanover Dynasty which still rules England as the House of Windsor. Because George could speak little English and was unfamiliar with English ways and customs, he relied on his cabinet, or prime ministers, to rule England. These ministers, chosen by the majority party in Parliament, placed the actual rule of the nation in Parliament’s hands. Parliament’s power was further increased by the Septennial Act in 1716, permitting Parliament to stay in session for seven years.</p>
<p class="indent">Though there were many advances, the government of England was still controlled by the upper classes. Ninety percent of the people without property could not vote. The House of Lords, whose members were all of noble birth and were not elected, was still as powerful as the House of Commons. Yet, Parliament’s control had grown until it could no longer be overruled by the king. Britain had become a limited monarchy with basic civil liberties for the people.</p>
<p class="indent">Parliamentary institutions in England developed primarily through evolution. In 1800, because of property and religious restrictions, only one out of six Englishmen could vote. No woman could vote. Gradually, reforms were instituted. In 1824&ndash;25, the Combination Acts were changed to permit the organisation of labor unions. In 1832, the first of the three Reform Bills was passed given voting rights to the middleclass. The House of Lords defeated the first bill once and threatened to do so again. When the king, however, said that he would appoint new liberal members, the House of Lords passed the bill. The Second Reform Bill (1867) allowed most city workers to vote. The Third Reform Bill (1884) gave the vote to farm workers. Finally, women received the right to vote in 1928.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">English Revolution</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Parliament’s Origin?</b></i></span> The origin of the British Parliamentary institution can be traced to the Magna Carta (1215 AD) which was signed by King John, and later confirmed and enlarged by Edward I. This charter established the principle that the king was equally bound by the laws as the subjects. The king conceded that in certain matters he would take a decision only with the consent of the Great Council, which was a nominated body consisting of royal officials, dignitaries of the Church and other nobles designated by the king. Apart from the Great Council, there was the Little Council, also known as the Curia Regis. The difference between the two was that the former was a greater body which met only thrice a year and discussed general questions of finance and justice, while the latter consisted of a few prominent members drawn from the former and advised the king regularly on specific administrative issues. In course of time, the Great Council grew into the Parliament, while the Little Council gave birth to the Privy Council which in turn gave rise to the Cabinet.</p>
<p class="indent">The Magna Carta was, no doubt, an agreement between the king and the feudal lords, for it dealt with the rights of the barons against the king. Every Englishman considered this charter as the basis of democracy giving way to representative institutions. It is a landmark of Parliamentary government, because some of its provisions, such as Clauses 12 and 14 have been interpreted to mean that taxation without the consent of the Parliament was unauthorised and illegal. Similarly, the king promised that “No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or outlawed or exiled... unless by the lawful judgment of his peer or by the law of the land”. In course of time, it has come to be regarded as a guarantee against arbitrary detention. Similarly clause 40 promised: “To none will we sell or to none will we deny or delay right and justice”. That is why, this charter has rightly been regarded as the Charter of Liberties.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-239" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00002.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">The Charter set off a process which was to end only when the power of the crown was put into the hands of the community at large. Naturally, it has had a profound and lasting influence on the imagination of the succeeding generations. Throughout the 13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the Struggle for the Charter was the battleground. Until the Edwardian Parliament was fully established, the charter remained in the foreground of men’s thoughts. In the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, however, it fell into the background. Parliament held the place in men’s minds which the charter had once occupied. In Tudor times, the charter was even more out of fashion, because it emphasised the distinction between the interests of the prince and people which, throughout the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, prince and people were equally anxious to deny.</p>
<p class="indent">Under James I, when prince and people again began to take up opposing grounds, Magna Carta returned with more than its old splendour. Under the banner of Runnymeda (it was the place at which the feudal lords extracted Magna Carta from King John), the battle of Parliament and the Common Law was fought and won against the Stuarts. In the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, Magna Carta was worshipped by Parliamentarians like Blackstone, Burke and all England. It had become the symbol for the spirit of democracy. The historical importance of Magna Carta, therefore, lay not only in what the men of 1215 intended by its clauses, but in effect which it had on the imagination of their descendants.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How and when did Parliament Grow?</b></i></span> The word Parliament, meaning ‘parley’ or discussion, was first used in Henry II’s reign to describe purely feudal assemblies of tenants-in-chief sitting with other members of the King’s Council. The term as yet conveyed no idea of election or representation, nor did it necessarily mean a legislative or tax-voting assembly. It was simply the king’s council met to “talk”, to debate high foreign and domestic politics, to discuss petitions, grievances, ways and means, and to <a id="calibre_link-240" class="calibre10"></a>conduct state trials. Having “talked”, it acted, for it was the symbol of all the powers in state. The method of selecting its members had not yet been defined. During the reign of Henry III himself, it became an occasional but not an invariable practice to summon to this great assembly two or more knights selected in each shire court to represent the county. Then, and for long afterwards, the summons to Parliament was often regarded as a burden. Communities often neglected to send their representatives, and even elected knights of the shire sometimes absconded. Thus, the elective franchise was not yet a privilege or a ‘right of man’.</p>
<p class="indent">British Parliament was not invented suddenly to perpetuate a revolution in which one power rose and another fell, it grew up gradually as a convenient means of smoothing out differences among various sections of British society. The English people have always been distinguished for their Committee sense, their desire to sit round and talk till an agreement or compromise is reached. This national peculiarity was the true origin of the British Parliament.</p>
<p class="indent">During the reigns of the first three Edwards, Parliament gradually acquired something like its present form. Edward viewed the frequent national assemblies as the best art for the machinery of government. His motives in frequently summoning the Parliament were both financial and administrative. He was aware of the value of support of the middle classes in shire and town in collecting taxes. The administrative motive was to make the royal power more efficient by keeping it in constant touch with the governed. He wanted to ascertain the grievances of his subjects, so as to be able to govern in accordance with real local needs, and to keep a check on the misdeeds of local officials. Hence, a large part of the business of these early Parliaments consisted in receiving piles of petitions for redress.</p>
<p class="indent">Significantly the English Parliament, unlike its counterparts in Europe, divided itself, not into three Estates of clergy, nobles and bourgeois, but into two Houses of Lords and Commons. In the continental system of ‘Estates’, all the ‘gentlemen’ were represented in the estate of the ‘noblesse’. The ‘noblesse’ was divided into two in the English Parliament. The ‘barones majors’ sat in the House of Lords, while the ‘barones minors’ sat along with knights and gentry in the House of Commons. No estate of clergy was formed as part of the English Parliament, though the bishops and certain of the greater abbots continued to sit in the House of Lords in their secular capacity as holders of baronies.</p>
<p class="indent">The House of Commons as a separate chamber originated in the unofficial meetings of the knights and burgesses, discussing anxiously behind closed doors what collective reply they should give to the higher powers. Because of their extreme caution, we know nothing of the internal developments of the early House of Commons. We do not know how and when the ‘speaker’ became its chairman. For the speaker was originally the person appointed to ‘speak’ for the Commons in full Parliament, the other knights and burgesses being silent in presence of their betters. Until Stuart times, the speaker was a servant of the crown much more than a servant of the House.</p>
<p class="indent">From the faltering steps in the reign of Edward I, the House of Commons made great strides in the next 150 years. The consent of its members became mandatory for all statues and taxation; their own petitions frequently received the assent of the king in Parliament and even the highest acts of state, like the deposition and election of kings took place with the Commons as parties to the deed. Their constitutional position provided invaluable precedents for the assumption of real power by the Lower House after the Tudor monarchs clipped the wings of Church and baronage. The reason for the rapid increase in the powers of the Commons is not far to seek. They were a third party holding the <a id="calibre_link-241" class="calibre10"></a>balance, and courted by the principals in the warfare of state. The constant struggle between the king and the barons, the constant struggle between the great families around the throne, put the Commons almost into the place of umpire. They could take full advantage of the position because their interests were not wholly bound with either barons or king.</p>
<p class="indent">Between 1327 and 1461, i.e., the accession of Edward III and the deposition of Henry VI respectively, the English Parliament acquired its present form as well as the outline of its modern procedure. The House of Commons equipped itself with the financial and legislative powers and even asserted an occasional control over the executive by impeachment of ministers before the Lords. Thus, precedents were set for the future use of Stuart Parliament.</p>
<p class="indent">Before the Commons could hope to deprive the king of his authority, an interval was necessary of increased royal power under the Tudors, to strengthen the framework of the state and reduce the nobles and clergy to the level of other subjects. Under the Tudors, when the Crown-in-Parliament affected a series of changes in ecclesiastical affairs, it was demonstrated beyond doubt that the state had acquired unlimited sovereign authority. The powers of the new state of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century could have been exercised only by the king. The Parliament during the Tudor period had neither the strength nor the ambition for such a part. Indeed, it was the main function of the Tudor Kings and their Privy Council to teach the Parliament men at Westminster the work of real government which had been so sadly neglected in the previous century. Parliament was ready to be the scholar and servant of royalty like an apprentice serving his time and fitting himself to become partner and heir.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Stuart era, English people developed a complete system of Parliamentary government, contrary to the prevailing tendencies on the continent, which was moving fast towards royal absolutism. While the Estates-General of France was ceasing to exercise even its medieval functions and the political life of Germany was regressing in the mosaic of petty principalities, the House of Commons made itself the governing organ of a modern nation. This was achieved by developing an elaborate system of committee procedure, and by striking down the royal power in a series of struggles of which the chief motive was religious but the chief result political.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides the Magna Carta, there were many other charters and reform acts which gave the final shape to this ‘representative institution’ of England. During the Stuart period, Petition of Right (1628) was an important step in strengthening the Parliament. Charles I (1625&ndash;1649) had violently clashed with the Parliament when it refused to grant him money. He, in fact, dissolved it and governed through a decree for a while. Ultimately he was compelled to agree to the Petition of Right in 1628 as a condition for raising money. This charter provided that</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">1.</b></span>no person could be compelled to pay taxes that were not authorised by the Parliament.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">2.</b></span>no person could be detained without disclosing to him the reason for detention and</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">3.</b></span>soldiers could not be billeted upon private houses without the owners’ consent.</p>
<p class="indent">The Petition of Right, like Magna Carta, was the beginning, not the end of a struggle for the principles it enunciated. The battle between the two sides (king and Parliament) had to be fought for England could no longer be governed by both at once. The first blood was drawn by Charles I, who, by dispensing with Parliament, removed every constitutional check upon his actions. But the last word was to lie with the ‘Long Parliament’ (1640&ndash;1660) which succeeded in defeating the king in the Great Civil War (1642&ndash;1646). After the execution of Charles I in 1649, England became a republic. The loyalty of <a id="calibre_link-242" class="calibre10"></a>the English people to the Crown was so strong that monarchy was restored (1660) within 18 months after the death of Oliver Cromwell, the Protector (1658). Charles II (1660&ndash;85), the son of Charles I, was asked to come back from his exile and accept the throne.</p>
<p class="indent">The most significant development, however, took place during the reign of James II (1685&ndash;88). It was marked by a revolution, known popularly as the Glorious Revolution (1688&ndash;1689), and the enactment of another great charter, viz., the Bill of Rights, also known as the Revolution Settlement (1689). James II, a staunch Catholic, after succeeding to the throne, started giving important positions to the Catholics, which was against the British system. Finally, he was forced to abdicate, and both the political parties &ndash; Whigs and Tories &ndash; decided to invite the former king’s daughter, Mary and son-in-law, William of Orange, to come and accept the English crown. Mary and William, who succeeded to the throne, consented to the Bill of Rights, which, following the example of Magna Carta and Petition of Right, provided that</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">1.</b></span>no tax could be levied without the consent of the Parliament.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">2.</b></span>the royal prerogatives of suspending laws and awarding punishments were declared illegal.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">3.</b></span>no standing army could be maintained in peace time without the consent of the Parliament.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">4.</b></span>the Parliament should be freely elected, should meet frequently and should have freedom of expression and</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">5.</b></span>no Catholic or a person married to Catholic could become the monarch of the country.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the Glorious Revolution and the Bill of Rights firmly established the supremacy of the Parliament and created a constitutional or limited monarchy in England.</p>
<p class="indent">The British Parliament, after having established its supremacy, passed several laws aimed at reforming its own composition and character. Several acts were enacted in order to extend the franchise in gradual stages. Tenant farmers in the counties (rural units) and the town middle classes were given the right to vote by the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832. Next, artisans and urban workers living in their own houses were given the franchise by the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1867. The third one in the series, the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1884, extended the Parliamentary Reform Acts, extended the franchise to the agricultural labourers also, thus making franchise uniform for both boroughs (towns) and counties. However, it was only in the beginning of the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century that franchise was given to women of all classes. The fourth Parliamentary Reform Act of 1918 gave what was practically manhood suffrage and a large installment of the new principle of woman’s suffrage, but not the universal adult suffrage. This last thing was left to the Equal Franchise Act of 1928.</p>
<p class="indent">This Act of 1928 was the most revolutionary in nature. It abolished property qualifications and distinction between men and women in respect of voting age. Like men, all women of 21 years of age were now given voting right.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly equal electoral districts were created by the same set of Acts. The Reform Act of 1832 abolished the rotten and pocket boroughs (Parliamentary units which continued to send representatives to the Parliament even after most of their population migrated to industrial areas with the advent of Industrialisation) and transferred their members to the industrial towns and counties. The Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884 completed this task of creating equal electoral districts.</p>
<p class="indent">Likewise, some other minor acts were passed with the aim of completing the reform of the Parliament. The Ballot Act of 1872, for instance, abolished the system of open voting and <a id="calibre_link-243" class="calibre10"></a>introduced that of secret ballot. Without this Act, the expansion of the franchise to agricultural workers would not have been possible. In the following year, the Corrupt Practices Act provided for restriction on bribing the voters. In 1911, another important statute was enacted which established the supremacy of the Commons and curtailed the powers of the House of Lords.</p>
<p class="indent">All the laws mentioned above were aimed at greater democratisation of the British Parliament. They firmly established the roots of Parliamentary system of government in Britain. In fact, the British Parliament became the supreme political institution of the country.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did Other institutions Grow?</b></i></span> The British Cabinet took birth in the late 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and early 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries. Like most British institutions, it <a id="calibre_link-244" class="calibre10"></a>was a creation of circumstances and not plan. It grew out of the Privy Council when that body became too unwieldy for effective transaction of business. Charles II (1660&ndash;1685) and Queen Anne (1702&ndash;1714) established the practice of consulting the leading ministers before the meeting of the larger Privy Council in order to discuss and settle matters more effectively. Though the practise was not accepted in the beginning, its obvious utility led to the rapid decline of the Privy Council and the growth of the Cabinet’s power. Through the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the Cabinet took the form and acquired most of the characteristics that mark it today.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00026.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">The greatest boost to its growth was given by an accident that brought the Hanoverians to the throne. The first two Georges were not much interested in British affairs and spoke little English. After 1717, the king stopped meeting his ministers, and during Robert Walpole’s lengthy ministry (1721&ndash;42) the Cabinet developed into an institutionalised decision making body centred around a chief or prime minister, though Walpole himself always denied being a prime minister. His long tenure established the principles (further strengthened under the Pits) that the Cabinet should be politically homogeneous and that it had to find adequate support in the House of Commons. His opponents’ failure to impeach him as a criminal when he was forced out of office in 1742 also demonstrated that political opposition could be accepted as loyal and legitimate rather than proscribed as treasonous&mdash;a principle essential to modern democracy.</p>
<p class="indent">A party system was also growing simultaneously. The mere alignment of personal factions of the early 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, loosely grouped under the labels of Whig and Tory (liberal and conservative respectively), became two fairly clear-cut and stable political parties by the early 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The two developments, in fact, went hand in hand; party provided a means by which Cabinet could organise it support, and the Cabinet provided a centre around which the party could grow.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Democratic Politics (1815&ndash;50)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Condition of England?</b></i></span> England had become the workshop of the world, yet, to many of its inhabitants, the days of prosperity and optimism were over, and the future was uncertain. Commerce was flourishing, industrial productivity was booming, exports were soaring, the nation led the world in manufacturing, the Empire had expanded across the globe. Yet there were many cracks in the wall and skeletons in the closet.</p>
<p class="indent">The great movement in population from the countryside to towns and urban squalor and poverty it created has been well-documented by such writers as Charles Dickens. Not even the Royal family could escape the dreaded cholera, rampant in London due to its tainted water supplies. Victoria’s uncle, William IV’s two daughters died in infancy and disease was rampant in the squalid slums of the rapidly growing cities and manufacturing towns.</p>
<p class="indent">The constant refusal of landlords to improve their properties, install proper sanitary facilities and relieve the burden of high rents was matched by the indifference of the factory and mine owners to the terrible working conditions of those they employed. Those who did care about their workers, such as Robert Owen, were few and far between. The government was forced to step in; only law could change the intolerable conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Reforms had tentatively begun under the Tory Party, which dominated in Parliament from 1812 to 1827 and under the dynamic Robert Peel as Home Office Minister. Peel reformed the criminal code, abolished the death penalty for over 100 offences, improved prison conditions and created the London Police force, the so-called “Bobbies.”</p>
<p class="indent">It was only a beginning. Reforms were greatly needed in every sector of British <a id="calibre_link-245" class="calibre10"></a>society. Not everyone had benefited from the improvements in agriculture and industry. Increasing enclosures of land had thrown hundreds of thousands of small landowners onto the mercy of the Parish or drawn them into the fast-growing cities to replenish the stock of poor and unemployed. Lord Byron, a hereditary peer in the House of Lords was not the only one to speak out against the evils of industrialisation. The poor had no representation in Parliament, for the system had long ago failed to represent anyone except a small privileged class. It was time for major changes.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1832, the Duke also had to acquiesce in the passing of the great Reform Bill of 1832 that, while doing nothing for the poorer classes, at long last recognised the right of the new manufacturing magnates and the middle-classes to govern England. It was a right long overdue, for the manufacturers and merchants had long been the chief factors in the economic life (and success) of England. Their agitation was their demand to be admitted into the elite of the ruling set. As the first formal change in electoral law, however, since an Act of 1430, it heralded further inevitable changes in the relationship between the old aristocratic oligarchy and the new men from the boroughs and manufacturing towns.</p>
<p class="indent">These reforms were not the work of the masses but of wealthy middle-class and aristocratic liberals along with a few intellectual radicals. The only reform movement initiated by the labouring class in this period was the Chartist movement. The hard-pressed urban workers, bitterly aware that they had been bypassed by the Reform Bill of 1832 and that they were not sharing in the unprecedented national prosperity, were dissatisfied with the reforms of the bourgeois liberals. In 1838, workingclass leaders drew up People’s Charter, which demanded (1) universal male suffrage, (2) secret ballot, (3) removal of property qualifications for members of Parliament, (4) pay for members of Parliament, (5) annual elections, and (6) equal electoral districts. The charter was twice presented to Parliament and twice summarily rejected. In 1848, Chartists planned a huge petition and demonstration in London. The frightened government prepared to use force. However, only a few mild disorders followed the third rejection, and the movement came to an end. Nevertheless, the Chartist movement had its influence. The most immediate result of the movement was to make both political parties aware of the growing influence of the working classes and of advisability of winning their favour. In the following decades, all the demands in the charter were enacted into law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the role of Parliamentary Reformers?</b></i></span> Although Great Britain had been for years a home of representative government, its government in 1815 was far from democratic. The suffrage was so severely restricted by property qualifications that only about 5 percent of the adult males could vote. Furthermore, the industrial cities of the North, which had emerged since the last distribution of seats in Parliament, were not represented at all. Both houses of Parliament were therefore monopolised by the landed aristocracy. It must be remembered, however, that the cleavage between the middle class and the aristocracy was not so sharp in Great Britain as on the Continent. The law of primogeniture in Great Britain granted the eldest son the entire landed estate and permitted him alone to assume the title. The younger sons sought careers in the Church, military, or business. This process brought about much intermingling between the upper and the middle classes. The long-sustained prosperity of’ British commerce had produced a merchant class wealthy enough to purchase respectability, lands, and sometimes titles. The aristocracy frequently invested in commercial enterprises and later in industry. These facts help to explain why the great political and <a id="calibre_link-246" class="calibre10"></a>social struggles in 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century Britain, though sometimes bitter, lacked the violence of those on the Continent.</p>
<p class="indent">A period of economic depression and unrest in Great Britain followed the ending of the Napoleonic wars in 1815. For 22 years, with only one brief interruption, Britain had been engaged in a desperate struggle with France, a struggle that was economic as well as military. Meanwhile, British industrial expansion had gone on apace. The war’s end found British warehouses piled high with unsold goods. Thousands of returning veterans found no jobs. Strikes and riots, which had begun during Napoleon’s blockade, increased. The conservative Tory party, which had seen the country through the war, was strongly entrenched in power. Both the Tories and the slightly more liberal Whigs were still badly frightened by the spectre of French revolutionary Jacobinism. The government, therefore, took strong measures against the restless workers. The writs of <i class="calibre8">habeas corpus</i> were suspended. The climax came in 1819 when troops fired on a crowd that had assembled outside Manchester to listen to reform speeches. Several were killed and hundreds injured in this Peterloo Massacre.</p>
<p class="indent">Within a few years, however, as the post-war crisis of depression and unrest eased, the Tory government yielded slightly to the pressure for reform. By 1822, Foreign Secretary Canning had already deserted Metternich’s reactionary concert of Europe and aided independence movements in Latin America and Greece. During the 1820s, the navigation laws were somewhat relaxed and the tariff slightly lowered. The Combination Laws were partially repealed, permitting labourers to organise unions, though not to strike. The civil disabilities against non-conforming Protestants and Roman Catholics were removed, permitting them to participate in political life on an equal basis with Anglicans. These measures, however, welcome as they were, did not get at the fundamental issue: a broadening of popular participation in the government. The pressure for suffrage reform would continue to mount, particularly from the industrial bourgeoisie, which was rapidly gaining wealth.</p>
<p class="indent">During the 1820s, Great Britain had already taken some moderate steps on the road to liberal reform, but these steps did not go to the heart of the matter &ndash; broadening the franchise. Pressures mounted on the conservative Tories to effect electoral reform, but they were unwilling or unable to do it. Finally in 1830, the aristocratic but more liberal Whigs, long out of power, drove the Tory government from office.</p>
<p class="indent">The new Prime Minister, Earl Grey, immediately introduced and forced through Parliament the Reform Bill of 1832. This bill redistributed the seats of the House of Commons, taking away many from the rotten boroughs (once-important towns that had dwindled in population or had even disappeared) and giving them to the industrial cities of the North. The suffrage was extended to all those who owned or rented property with an annual value of ten pounds. It is estimated that the number of eligible voters was thereby increased from approximately 450,000 to 800,000 out of a total population of some 16 million. Although on the surface, the Reform Bill of 1832 appears innocuous, it represents a great turning point in British history. The long era of dominance of the conservative landed aristocracy was ending and that of more liberal property owners, including the commercial and industrial bourgeoisie, had begun. The supremacy of the House of Commons over the House of Lords, which had opposed the Reform Bill, was established. A new period of political and social reform had opened.</p>
<p class="indent">Both political parties recognised the new era. The Whig party, supported by the industrial bourgeoisie but containing a right wing of liberal aristocrats and left wing of intellectual radicals, changed its name to the Liberal party. For the next half-century, the Liberals were <a id="calibre_link-247" class="calibre10"></a>often in power, under the leadership of such personalities as Lord Grey, Lord John Russell, Viscount Palmerston, and eventually William E. Gladstone. The Tory party was still predominantly the party of the landed aristocracy, but it contained some bourgeois elements, and its more liberal wing, led first by Sir Robert Peel and later by Benjamin Disraeli, was now in ascendancy. The somewhat discredited Tory designation was changed to Conservative.</p>
<p class="indent">Both parties, conscious of the rising importance of public opinion, supported a series of reforms. In 1833, slavery was abolished in the British Empire with compensation for slave owners. The Municipal Corporations Act applied the principles of the Reform Bill of 1832 to local government. The old penal code was reformed, reducing the number of capital offences to three and generally softening the punishment of criminals. The penny post increased the circulation of mail and literature. Parliament granted small but gradually increasing subsidies to the schools, most of which were run by the Anglican Church. Between 1833 and 1847, Parliament passed a series of laws that prohibited the employment in textile mills of children under nine and limited the hours of older children and of women to 10 hours a day. The employment of women and children in underground mines was prohibited. In 1846, the Corn Laws (the import tariff on grain), long opposed by liberals and the object of a major reform movement, were repealed, reducing the price of bread.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Who were Free Traders?</b></i></span> The growing middle classes, who were prospering from the Industrial Revolution, found intellectual support and justification for their interests in the doctrine of economic liberalism in general, and <i class="calibre8">laissez faire</i> or free trade philosophy in particular. This doctrine has been best stated by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith in his classic, <i class="calibre8">Wealth of Nations</i> (1776). The essence of Smith’s theory is that economics, like the physical world, has its own natural laws. The most basic of the economic laws is that of supply and demand. When left to operate alone, these laws will keep the economy in balance and, in the long run, work to the benefit of all. If the sanctity of property and contracts is respected, competition and free enterprise will provide incentive and keep prices down. Government regulations and collective bargaining only impede the workings of the natural laws of economics and destroy incentive. Government should therefore follow a policy of <i class="calibre8">laissez faire</i>, limiting its activities in the economic field to enforcement of order and of contracts, public education and health, national defence, and in rare instances the encouragement of necessary industries that private enterprise does not find profitable. Here was a theory readymade for the industrial capitalists, who already held all the trump cards.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00056.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Adam Smith</p>
<p class="indent">A strong boost was given to <i class="calibre8">laissez faire</i> thinking by a young Anglican clergyman, Thomas Malthus, who in 1789 published his <i class="calibre8">Essay on Population.</i> Malthus argued that since population increases by a geometric ratio whereas food supply increases only by an arithmetic ratio, it is a basic natural law that population will outstrip the food supply. This alleged law has two important implications. One is that nothing can be done to improve the lot of the masses. If their condition is temporarily improved they will immediately produce children in such numbers that the food supply will be outstripped and starvation will threaten all. Only poverty and privation hold them in check. The second implication is that the rich are not to blame for the misery of the poor; the <a id="calibre_link-248" class="calibre10"></a>poor are themselves responsible because of their incontinence. These ideas were so soothing to so many of the book-buying upper classes that Malthus quickly attained fame and wealth.</p>
<p class="indent">David Ricardo supplied further support for policies of economic liberalism. Having made a fortune in stock market speculation while still a young man, Ricardo purchased a seat in Parliament and spent the rest of his life thinking and writing on economics. In <i class="calibre8">The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</i> (1817), he propounded the law of rent and the iron law of wages. Rent is determined by the difference in productivity of land. Take off all restrictions and subsidies, and the poorest land goes out of cultivation, reducing the rent on the more productive lands proportionately. He argued for this idea so forcefully that it played an important part in the repeal of England’s Corn Laws, which had maintained the price of grain at an artificially high level. Lower grain prices meant lower bread prices, which enabled industrial capitalists to pay lower subsistence wages to their workers. More important in economic thinking was Ricardo’s iron law of wages, according to which the natural wage is the subsistence level and the market wage tends to conform to it. Raise the market wage and the workers will multiply so rapidly that soon the law of supply and demand will bring the market wage down below the subsistence level. The workers will die off from malnutrition and disease and slow down their reproduction rate. Eventually, they will become so scarce as to be able to bid the market wage up above the natural wage. Always, though, the pull is toward the subsistence level. This theory again was music to the ears of the industrial capitalists.</p>
<p class="indent">These economic liberals, being some of the earliest thinkers to analyse the economics of industrial capitalism, are often called the classical economists. Their ideas were popularised in Great Britain and spread to the Continent. There they were modified and expounded by men such as Jean Baptiste Say and Frederic Bastiat.</p>
<p class="indent">A related stream of economic liberalism was initiated by the British Utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham as early as 1789, in his <i class="calibre8">Principles of Morals and Legislation.</i> Bentham was an 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century materialistic rationalist who lived until 1832, bridging the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries with his life and thought. The Utilitarians believed that the useful is the good and that the chief purpose of government and society is to achieve “the greatest good to the greatest number.” Since every individual is the best judge of his or her own best interests, the surest way to achieve general happiness is to allow individuals to follow their enlightened self-interest. Individualism, then, is the best safeguard of the general welfare. At the same time, Bentham himself and several of his followers saw the necessity for the state to act for the common welfare. Utilitarians became active during the middle decades of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century in promoting legislation and creating governmental bureaucracies to handle some of the economic abuses and social problems connected with the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, economic liberalism evolved as industrial capitalists proved unwilling to adhere to <i class="calibre8">laissez faire</i> when it did not suit their interests, as the economic and social inequities of industrialism became too abhorrent to humanitarian sensibilities, and as perceptive criticisms of economic liberalism became persuasive. The most influential thinker to lead in this evolution of economic liberalism was John Stuart Mill (1806&ndash;1873). Mill, a child prodigy, was brought up to be a good Benthamite. However, he was too sensitive and humanitarian to remain in the hard materialist camp of the Utilitarians. Moreover, living a generation after Smith, Malthus, Ricardo, and Bentham, he was able to see some of the social effects of the Industrial Revolution. Although <a id="calibre_link-249" class="calibre10"></a>Mill in no way rejected private property and free enterprise, he believed that in the industrial age restrictions must be instituted by the state for the protection of the poor. Although production is bound by the laws of supply and demand, the distribution of goods is not. Public utilities such as railroads and gas and waterworks are natural monopolies and should be owned by the state. The state should provide free compulsory education for all and regulate child labour. He favoured income and inheritance taxes as economic equalisers. Mill’s chief work on economics, <i class="calibre8">Principles of Political Economy,</i> was published in 1848. Mill was also the first influential philosopher in modem times to advocate equal rights for women. His <i class="calibre8">Subjection of Women,</i> which appeared in 1869, came to be considered the classic statement on the subject of women’s rights. In his later years, he considered himself a moderate socialist. More than other 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century liberals, many of his views fit those of 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century liberalism.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Role of Chartists?</b></i></span> The British working class was without representation in Parliament: they turned to Chartism to redress their grievances. Early attempts at forming workers’ unions had failed miserably, their leaders denounced as gin-swilling degenerates and their members expelled from their work places. The workers then turned to violence, forming groups such as the Scotch Cattle that destroyed property and threatened workers. The great depression of 1829, with its massive unemployment and wage cuts led to the great Merthyr Rising in South Wales, now heavily industrialised and influenced by many of its Irish immigrants. Order was brought into the area by the military, and punishment was severe. Dic Penderyn was hanged for wounding a soldier; becoming a martyr for the Welsh workers.</p>
<p class="indent">The Chartists now began to recruit in earnest. The movement was named after the radical London reformer William Levett, who drafted a bill known as The People’s Charter in May 1838. The Chartists hoped to bring about a democratic parliament and an enfranchised working class. They staged demonstrations in many towns and when the government refused to consider the six points of the Charter presented in June 1839 took to arms. The biggest demonstration took place in South Wales, at Newport, where thousands of marchers, coming into the town in columns from the coal-mining valleys, were shattered by well-directed volleys from a body of troops (chiefly recruited in Ireland) stationed in the Westgate Hotel.</p>
<p class="indent">The repeal of the infamous Corn Laws in 1846 and the consequent availability of cheap bread meant that people were less inclined to revolution. The Chartist Movement, faced with the might of the British military and a recalcitrant government, was fading by the late 1850s. In 1857, an Act declared that property qualifications were no longer necessary for a seat in Parliament, and the first great democratising point of the Charter had been conceded by the government.</p>
<p class="indent">Not to be overlooked was the introduction of canned foods, created for the Royal Navy, but sold commercially by the London firm of Donkin-Hall in 1814 that eventually helped alleviate shortages caused by bad harvests (the industry took advantage of the vacuum pan recently invented by Edward Howard). In 1867, the Great Reform Bill finally ended the Chartist Movement, for in that year, nearly one million voters were added to the register, nearly doubling the electorate. Forty-five new seats were created, and the vote given to many working men as well as tenants of small farms. From henceforth, governments had to heed the voice of the middle and lower classes; its resources had to be used to benefit all of society, and not just the privileged few, and the State came to play a leading part in the lives of Britain’s citizens.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-30"><b class="calibre9">BEGINNING OF CAPITALISM</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The renewal of city life and the commercial revival of Europe led to the use of money in economic life, thereby undermining the feudal order that had developed after the fall of Rome. The bonds of serfdom could not be preserved in the changing circumstances. Serfs, particularly in Western Europe, increasingly paid for their land with money rather than labour, so that feudal lords became landlords and serfs became free peasants. The weakening of serfdom was a prerequisite to the expansion of Europe. It created a more fluid society that could accumulate the capital, provide the organisation and free the manpower needed for the work of exploration, conquest and settlement. It is not accidental that among the European nations, the degree of success in overseas enterprise was in direct ratio to the degree of liberation from the bonds of feudalism.</p>
<p class="indent">Use of money undermined the feudal craft and merchant guilds in the towns. The guilds, with their strict regulation of workmanship, and pricing and trading practices, were geared not to making profit but to preserve a traditional way of life. Guild members were committed to the concept of ‘just price’, and profiteering at the expense of a neighbour was considered unethical and definitely un-Christian. These concepts and practices broke down with the <a id="calibre_link-254" class="calibre10"></a>coming of the entrepreneur. They avoided the guilds by purchasing raw material and taking it to underemployed artisans in the countryside, who laboured on a piece-work basis. The rationale of this ‘putting-out’ system was profit rather than ‘just price’. The entrepreneurs paid as little as possible for the material and labour, and they sold the finished product as dearly as possible in order to secure maximum return on their capital investment.</p>
<p class="indent">Europe’s economy changed not only by the growing use of money but also by the minting of standardised coins that were acceptable everywhere, and by the development of banks and of credit instruments. Florence led the way in 1252 with the gold florin, and other cities and states soon followed. Simple bills of exchange also appeared in Italy as early as the 12<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Gradually, mighty banking families appeared, first in Italy and later in Northern Europe. The trend led inevitably to the abandonment of medieval Christianity’s strong condemnation and ban on the charging of interest. For centuries, churchmen had preached against interest, as constituting usury. By the middle of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, quite a few of them were pleading for the recognition of a moderate and acceptable usury.</p>
<p class="indent">What was happening to Europe, then, was a historic shift to a fundamentally different type of economic system, the type known today as ‘Capitalism’. It has been defined as a ‘system in which the desire for profits is the driving motive and in which large accumulations of capital are employed to make profits by various elaborate and often indirect methods’. Its beginning was epoch making. For it affected not merely the economic but all aspects of life. While in the early Middle Ages, money had been peripheral and little used, by the late Middle Ages, it provided energy that was responsible for Europe’s further meteoric rise. No earlier societies or economic systems had been based on the notion of growth.</p>
<p class="indent">Their aim had been only to maintain the material well-being of the past rather than to enhance it. Henceforth, with capitalism, the precise opposite was the case. Profits now were ploughed back to increase the quantity of capital available for production. ‘Capitalising’ of profits, in the sense that surplus was converted into more capital, is the rationale behind the term ‘capitalism’.</p>
<p class="indent">The ‘capitalist’ was not content with making a living but was driven by the urge to enlarge his assets. He did not cease his efforts when his needs for consumption were satisfied. The new ‘capitalist spirit’ is epitomised by the statement of Jacob Fugger, the wealthiest banker of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, who said: “Let me earn as long as I am able.”</p>
<p class="indent">As significant for Europe’s economy as the flourishing banks were the new jointstock companies, the counterpart in early modern times of the multinational corporations of today. These new organisations were most effective instruments for economic mobilisation and penetration. Anyone who wished to speculate with a little bit of his money could do so without risking his whole future. He risked only the amount he invested in company shares, and he could not be held further liable for whatever losses the company might incur. Furthermore, there was no need for the individual investors to know or trust each other or to concern themselves with the specific conditions of the market and the policies of the company.</p>
<p class="indent">These details of management were entrusted to directors who in turn could choose dependable individuals to manage company affairs in the field. This arrangement made it attractive for all sorts of scattered individuals to invest their savings in individual ventures. In this way it was possible to mobilise European capital easily and simply, and vast amounts were invested in various overseas undertakings. No Eastern merchant, limited <a id="calibre_link-255" class="calibre10"></a>to his own sources or those of his partners, and choosing his managers from his family or circle of acquaintances, could hope to compete with the powerful and impersonal joint-stock company. It became the instrument for the operation of European capitalism on a global scale.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Meant by Capitalism?</b></i></span> Capitalism, according to Hobson, “is the organisation of business on a large scale by an employer or a company of employers possessing an accumulated stock of wealth wherewith to acquire raw materials and tools and hire labour, so as to produce an increased quantity of wealth which shall constitute profit.”</p>
<p class="indent">The distinguishing traits of capitalism, therefore, are:</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(a)</b></span>a money economy,</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(b)</b></span>a sizeable market,</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(c)</b></span>large scale operation of the means of production and distribution, privately owned,</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(d)</b></span>intense competition, and</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(e)</b></span>rational and precise business methods.</p>
<p class="indent">The complex phenomena which comprise the capitalist system have their roots in the Middle Ages. To appreciate its evolution, it is necessary to recall the limitations of medieval commerce. Trade was restricted by the medieval idea of local selfsufficiency and of production for use rather than for profit. From the later Middle Ages, however, a wider intercourse with the East and proliferation of intra-European commercial contacts tended to break down the manorial ideal and to provide opportunities for the exploitation of more extensive markets. The Crusades greatly contributed to the development of towns in Europe as well as to the wealth of the seaports which profited by them and were the first to recover from the general stagnation of trade and industry in the early Middle Ages.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">When and how did it Come into Being?</b></i></span> At the dawn of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century both the manorial system and the guild system were in decay. Landlords were receiving money rents in place of exacting personal services and payments in kind. Merchant guilds were becoming exclusive and aristocratic. Craft guilds were facing competition from manufactures outside the guilds, and many a journeyman was sinking to the position of a hired laborer.</p>
<p class="indent">The rise of national monarchies went hand in hand with the revival of trade. For the national monarchs could forbid private warfare, eliminate local tariff barriers, maintain law and order and enact and enforce a uniform body of commercial law. Barter gave way to a money economy and whether the change arose from a reviving commerce or from the minting of increased quantities of hard money, the point is that it was the most significant aspect of the transformation of an essentially medieval economy into a modern one, and that it stimulated commerce. It is arguable that the Protestant ethic created the necessary mental atmosphere for the beginning and development of capitalism.</p>
<p class="indent">It was in towns that the new capitalist spirit was most in evidence. Certain guildsmen who had managed to accumulate personal wealth, outsiders who had settled in towns and amassed fortunes, members of the landed nobility who brought their wealth and settled in cities, wealthy officials of the state or the Church &ndash; all put their ‘savings’ (i.e., capital) in the extension of trade, and as trade increased, cities grew which, in turn, raised the value of city land and added an ‘unearned increment’ to their capital.</p>
<p class="indent">The Italian cities profited most from the expansion of commerce and it was there that banking, a great agency of capitalism, was first established. Florentine banking houses established branches in other parts of Europe, and independent banking developed in <a id="calibre_link-256" class="calibre10"></a>Venice, Genoa, etc. Interest rates in this period fluctuated between 10 and 50 per cent. Henry VIII of England fixed it at 10 per cent, and other monarchs followed suit. There also developed a host of capitalistic techniques such as the sea loan and the bill of exchange. The former enabled merchants to expand their operations, insured those operations, and opened an investment avenue for surplus capital. The latter eliminated the risk and expense involved in the transfer of money.</p>
<p class="indent">The emerging capitalist enterprise was both accelerated and accentuated by Europe’s new relationship with Asia, Africa and America. It brought to Europe natural and human resources (slaves) and monetary treasures that it lacked. These were obtained in a variety of ways: by military plunder, as in Mexico and Peru; by forced and unequal trade, whether conducted by the Portuguese in India or by the Spaniards in the New World; and by imposition of taxes and tributes and trade restrictions on both natives and colonists abroad. Slavery was the overseas labor basis of rising European Capitalism.</p>
<p class="indent">Though for a time Lisbon and Seville supplanted Venice and Genoa as the leading commercial entrepots for Europe, the chief profits from overseas did not remain in Spain or Portugal, where only a small minority, principally from the bourgeoisie, concerned themselves directly with distant commercial and colonial undertakings. The masses were confined to agriculture which was backward.</p>
<p class="indent">Hence, the monarchs and prospectors of these countries had recourse to foreign bankers for the funds they needed for capital investment and the ultimate returns also went more to foreigners. The Italians too lost their pre-eminence to the Germans and the Netherlanders. The challenge posed by the Ottoman Turks and competition from Portugal and Spain in the matter of new trade routes adversely affected the Italians. Venetian trade suffered as Lisbon and Seville came into prominence and consequently Venetian manufacturing declined. On the other hand, bankers of Germany and Netherlands were in a position to supply needful capital and reap the rich rewards. They were badly affected by the advance of the Turks. They could freely develop their traditional trade with Russia, Scandinavia, England, etc. They had mineral stores which enabled them to improve and extend their manufactures. Nor were they rivals of the Portuguese and Spaniards. However, if the major capitalistic profits passed at once from Spain and Portugal to Germany and the Netherlands, a considerable share was dispersed by means of exchanges as that of Antwerp manufacturers and money lenders of other European countries.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, by the end of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, capitalism was firmly rooted in European economy. This was aided and confirmed by the price revolution. Because wages usually tended to rise more slowly than prices, manufacturers could earn profits. The merchant too was helped, for the goods he had in storage or abroad ships tended to rise in price while he held them. In short, ‘price revolution’ helped to fix the capitalist system on Western and Central Europe.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Begin?</b></i></span> By the beginning of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>century, both manorial system and guild system were in decay. For the landlords were receiving money rents from free tenants while hiring agricultural labour, and merchants and craft guilds were unable to function in the old fashion. The spirit of gaining financial profits was approved of even by Christian priests, particularly the Protestant. The emergence of towns as important centres of capitalist enterprise was another crucial factor. The inhabitants of these towns were not traditional guild leaders wedded to the concept of ‘just price’, but ambitious and enterprising persons intent on utilising their independence to amass wealth. Whatever deficiencies Europe <a id="calibre_link-257" class="calibre10"></a>suffered from, particularly lack of human and natural resources, were overcome by the new European contacts with the New World and Asia. Moreover, the economic practices and theories, known as mercantilism, completed the process of the emergence of capitalism by providing precious money from outside to help the evolution of currency, banking and financial institutions. The beginning of capitalism was also made feasible by the cumulative impact of several other developments such as the crusades, geographical discoveries, rise of national monarchs, accumulation of capital and spread of capitalist spirit, scientific developments like mariner’s compass, astrolabe, telescope and new methods of ship-building.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Outcome?</b></i></span> The beginning of capitalism dealt a body blow to medieval agriculture. Nobles tended to become absentee landlords in trying to earn more profit from their estates. They substituted money rents for the traditional services payments in kind of their peasants. Manors were rented out. This was, without doubt, detrimental to the peasants’ welfare. Many peasants, in fact, from a position of tenants, became agricultural labourers. The new capitalism also contributed to the ‘enclosure’ movement in England and to similar movements in other countries, all of which were directed towards an increased action of manufacturing staples, mostly wool, for important markets, and alongside towards a decreased employment of skilled farm labour.</p>
<p class="indent">It brought about significant changes in European industry as well. The guilds were already in decline and now they succumbed completely. They were forced to alter their status or to yield to destructive competition. They admitted capitalists to membership and under the latter’s leadership changed themselves into corporations which adopted the domestic system. Or else, the remaining purely local entities, they sought employment with capitalist middlemen. Outside the guilds, the ‘putting-out’ system appeared, whereby a capitalist middleman bought raw material, put it out to artisans to be worked in their houses for wages, and sold the finished product.</p>
<p class="indent">Europe also experienced extraordinary social strains and stresses. The gulf between the rich and the poor widened; the rich became richer, and the poor poorer. There was an epidemic of peasant revolts against greedy landlords, and the towns suffered growing pains. The ‘putting-out’ system differentiated more sharply between capital and labour, debasing the latter. It tended to substitute, for the close tie between the master and apprentice, an impersonal relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">Particularly noteworthy was the rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie to hitherto unprecedented influence and distinction. In union with them, the kings overawed both nobility and clergy. Many of them married into the nobility or gained admission into the ranks of the nobility by rendering service to the monarch. Gradually, members of the nobility also realised the advantages of investing in trade and manufacture. Capitalistic agriculture allied itself with capitalistic commerce and industry, and laid the basis for the supremacy of the middle classes.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-31"><b class="calibre9">AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The beginning of the modern period in Western Europe was marked by, among other things, a considerable growth in agricultural productivity, which has been described as ‘Agricultural Revolution’. Though agriculture has been the main occupation of the people for centuries, hardly any improvement was made in its technique as late as 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The same methods and tools were used by most people as had been used for centuries. Few new crops were introduced in Western Europe until after the Crusades and the voyages of discovery. The fundamental cause for this lack of improvement <a id="calibre_link-258" class="calibre10"></a>was the absence of sufficient demands for agricultural commodities beyond home consumption. Almost everyone produced what they needed for themselves. Not until workers began to labour full time for an employer and large cities came into existence, was there a demand for agricultural products.</p>
<p class="indent">The so-called Agricultural Revolution was neither complicated nor far-reaching in its effects as was the subsequent Industrial Revolution. Yet it involved several great changes such as the introduction of machinery, new crops, drainage of waste lands, use of fertilisers, and improvements in stock-breeding. It also necessitated the enclosure of the common land and the concentration of land into large holdings. The main motive in these changes was increased production and the attainment of profit from the new adventure.</p>
<p class="indent">Of the many changes that took place during the Agricultural Revolution, few were more important than the Norfolk four-course system, characterised by the disappearance of the fallow year and by a new emphasis on fodder crops. Established in Norfolk County and in several other counties in England before the end of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the new system became fairly general in much of continental Europe in the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. In order to adopt this Norfolk system, it was first necessary to alter the 1000-year old layout of the arable fields. It was virtually impossible for an individual farmer to grow fodder crops on his strips of land in open fields; at certain seasons these fields were opened to grazing by the livestock of the whole community. On enclosed land, however, a farmer could cultivate fodder crops and benefit from his own efforts. Consequently, there was a rapid acceleration of the enclosure movement in England, and on the Continent it took place slightly later. The movement towards change was further intensified by the invention of new farm machines, improvements in farm implements, and scientific interest and new biological theories relating to farm and animal life.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Meant by Agricultural Revolution?</b></i></span> Influence in society had long been dependent largely upon the possession of land. The great landed proprietor was considered superior to merchant or manufacturer, regardless of how much money the latter might control. Political prestige also was obtained through the control of land. This was one means through which the capitalist could rival the hereditary aristocracy, and he took advantage of it. Gentlemen farmers had personal pride in improving their land and became exponents of an improved agriculture. There was also the added possibility of making money in agriculture.</p>
<p class="indent">Wars, growth in the number of wage-earners, and increase in population raised the price of agricultural products to a point where profit could be made in raising them. Finally, the capitalist did more than anyone else to break down the medieval system, which had prevented progress in farming. Science was used in agriculture, as well as in industry, to produce more at less expense.</p>
<p class="indent">To consider the nature of the Agricultural Revolution, we have to answer two basic questions. First, was there really a profound change and break in the evolution of agricultural life in Western Europe? Secondly, if there was, when and where did it occur? It is a fact that an important break did occur in the technical conditions and hence in the productivity of agriculture in Western Europe between 1600 and 1800. From technical point of view, European agriculture in the early 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century closely resembled that of the beginning of the modern era and was in any case not superior to that of the Roman world. Hence the level of agricultural productivity in Western Europe at the beginning of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century was fundamentally no different from that of 20 centuries earlier, though there was some progress.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-259" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">When did it Take Place?</b></i></span> The break in Europe’s Agricultural Revolution also becomes apparent with the almost total disappearance of famines in Western Europe from 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century onwards. Thus, between 1600 and 1800, a definite break occurred in the evolution of agricultural production. We can assign the following approximate periods for the onset of the Agricultural Revolution in various West European countries:</p>
<p class="list"><b class="calibre9"><span class="space">1.</span>England:</b> 1690&mdash;1700</p>
<p class="list"><b class="calibre9"><span class="space">2.</span>France:</b> 1750&mdash;1760</p>
<p class="list"><b class="calibre9"><span class="space">3.</span>Germany and Denmark:</b> 1790&mdash;1800;</p>
<p class="indent">These periods should be taken as only approximate and subject to revision because there are few studies on the subject and also the regional differences in most of the countries are more marked. Though in the earliest stages of the Agricultural Revolution, England merely copied Flemish methods, local innovations nevertheless gradually gained the upperhand. From about 1730 down to the middle of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, it was England that became the Mecca of agricultural experts, and its example became the model for the Agricultural Revolution in the rest of Europe.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Take Place?</b></i></span> The Agricultural Revolution was characterised by a number of important developments and innovations such as the gradual elimination of fallow land by continuous rotation of crops, introduction and extension of new crops, enlargement of land holdings through ‘Enclosure Movement’, improvement of traditional farm implements and introduction of new implements, breeding of animals, and extension and improvement of arable land.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to the Revolution, the European agriculture, in order to avoid exhausting soil, was on two main types of rotation: (1) Biennial rotation (i.e., a year of cultivation alternating with a year of fallow) and (2) Triennial rotation (i.e., two years of cultivation followed by a year of fallow). Now the soil was regenerated in a number of ways: (a) Through planting a sequence of crops, each of which had a different consumption, at a different depth, of various chemical substances from the soil; (b) Through the introduction of plants having a regeneration effect; and above all (c) Through lavish manuring which was furthered by the expansion of livestock rearing made possible by the inclusion of fodder crops in the system of rotation. This type of exploitation of the land, as it did an effective integration between farming and herding, led to the gradual elimination of the fallow lands and hence to an increase in the productivity of land.</p>
<p class="indent">The Agricultural Revolution is associated with the names of certain innovators who pioneered in the employment of new crops and techniques. Among them Charles Viscount Townsend of England is the most important. He experimented with various plants which could be rotated with grains, and discovered that by growing clover (which captures nitrogen from the air and returns it to the soil) and turnips (which loosened the soil), he could get a good return on a piece of land every year. He became a staunch advocate of using turnips in his rotation system. Among his innumerable disciples, Coke of Holkam standardised a four-crop rotation on the lines suggested by Townsend, a practice which became known as the ‘Norfolk System’. In this system, wheat was grown in the first year, followed by turnips in the second, barley in the third, and finally clover and ryegrass in the fourth year. This new system was cumulative in effect, for the fodder crops eaten by the livestock produced large supplies of previously scarce animal manure. Introduced in the Norfolk county first and then in the countries of England by the close of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, it became fairly common on the newly enclosed farms by 1800. During the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, it was also adopted in much of Continental Europe. Furthermore, non-England lands made important contributions of their own to Agricultural Revolution. Parmenlier, a Frenchman, did much to popularise potato upon the Continent by writing a book on its usefulness. A German chemist showed in 1747 that sugar can be obtained from beets, a discovery which was to have a profound impact on the sugar plantations of the West Indies in the course of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-260" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00109.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Englosure Movement in England</p>
<p class="indent">In order to adopt the Norfolk system, it was, however, essential to change the ageold layout of the cultivated and cultivable lands. Consequently, there was a rapid acceleration of the Enclosure Movement in England. Enclosures meant the rearrangement of formerly common or open-fields into self-contained private land units or the division of formerly common but uncultivated land into private property. From about 1760, landlords speeded up the process of converting the land into a patchwork of purely individual holdings by systematic use of the Acts of Parliament. Thus previously it was virtually impossible for an individual farmer to grow fodder crops on his strips of land in open fields, but now because of the enclosed land he could cultivate these crops and benefit from them. On the Continent, the tendency of the French and German peasants to keep their properties subdivided did not, however, check the expansion of the seigneurial properties. Besides, the enlargement of the lands in France and Germany never got out of hand, nor did it destroy the small and medium peasant land ownership. In Spain, the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century witnessed <a id="calibre_link-261" class="calibre10"></a>a strengthening of seigneurial landownership, both secular and ecclesiastical. The urge to expand the properties so as to benefit from the prosperous economic situation not only caused encroachments on communal lands and grazing grounds, but also prompted the big landowners to lay claim to peasant farms under conditions highly favourable to them.</p>
<p class="indent">The ploughs and farm machinery are probably of the Dutch origin. Rotherham plough, the main design of which has remained virtually unchanged to this day, was first put into use in the Netherlands, England and Scotland during the first half of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The first factory for making ploughs was established in England in 1783. Though the problem of mechanising harvest work was not solved until the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, fairly simple threshing machines were designed and put into use of 1800.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, a variety of machines for such tasks as preparing animal feed, chopping turnips and cutting chaff were designed and used. An Englishman, Jethro Tull, became famous for innovations in field husbandry like the horsedrawn hoe and seed-drill. Robert Bakewell, another Englishman, experimented widely with new agricultural techniques and new crops, especially grasses, but he is best known for his efforts to improve breeds of sheep, horses and cattle.</p>
<p class="indent">While new fodder crops were introduced into the rotation, more and better livestock were bread and kept. Animal size increased and meat development was greater. In cows, milk yield improved. Better breeding increased fleece and flesh production in sheep, and also increased the size of pigs’ bread. In this sphere of livestock breeding, one cannot but remember the contribution of Bakewell and his efforts to improve breeds of sheep, horses and cattle. He engaged himself in selective and controlled breeding in an empirical way and achieved considerable success.</p>
<p class="indent">The process of land clearance, though a constant feature of agrarian history, was accelerated and new techniques were used to drain marshy areas in this period. Walter Blithe, a captain in Cromwell’s army, was interested in land drainage and irrigation in the form of water meadows (i.e., pieces of low, flat land capable of being kept in fertility by being overflowed from some adjoining stream). During his life time, considerable drainage work was carried out in Eastern England. At the same time, water meadows were constructed in Southwest England. This system was wellknown and of longstanding in Germany. Similarly, there were sporadic attempts to drain wetlands in France and Italy. At this time, drainage of humid land was introduced and became much more widely practiced. Finally, the greater use of horse in agriculture, instead of oxen, consequently led to a corresponding rise in productivity in a great deal of farmwork.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Outcome?</b></i></span> Some profound social changes in England first and then in the Continent were due chiefly to the Agricultural Revolution during which the old order was de-established and new classes appeared. There was a new landed aristocracy, coming mainly from the mercantile class, who invested in land earnings that they made from trade. Besides, there was a mass of agricultural labourers, who had been deprived of their own holdings by the ‘Enclosure’ movement. Finally, there was considerable group of renters who tilled the land for the wealthy owners. The old Yeomanry (independent peasant) class disappeared from the farms, many of them being forced to seek employment in the cities. This change in agriculture was an integral part of the transformation of a society that was predominantly agricultural into one that was industrial. By means of the changes, productivity was greatly increased; but in the process of change, poorer agricultural classes suffered immensely.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-262" class="calibre10"></a>The overall economic effect of the Agricultural Revolution was in removing the threat of famine in Europe, particularly Western Europe. To Europeans, the problem was no longer that of hunger but of obesity. Even during the worst droughts Europeans could produce more than what they needed. This agricultural progress generally raised the living standards of the people and led to increased birth rate. The prosperity in agriculture created demand for goods and services, and great fillip was given to the other sectors of economy, industry and commerce. Agriculture also helped industry in providing raw materials as well as in releasing labour force from the rural areas which could be employed in the industries.</p>

<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Colonies were built in lands discovered by the explorers and worldwide markets and trade systems developed. Merchants and manufacturers in the home nations obtained new products and raw materials from the colonies. Europeans obtained new products and raw materials from the colonies. Finished products were sent for sale in the colonies. Europeans obtained spices, gems, porcelain and cloth from Asia. Tobacco, potatoes, cocoa and corn, were sent from America to Europe. Other American goods included furs, codfish, sugar and dyes. From Africa, Europe obtained ivory, gold and silver. The African slave trade soon became profitable with the expansion of trade. Europe had to develop many new methods of doing business. The entire period of change, from about 1500 to 1750, was called ‘Commercial Revolution’.</p>
<p class="indent">Many changes were made in the business methods. Money was needed to pay trading expenses. Large banking systems, under control of individual families, developed and provided loans, often at high interest rates. The different coins used by different countries presented problems. Because the costs of sending trading expeditions were so great, joint-stock companies were formed. One such was the English East India Company, formed in 1600. Another was the Dutch East India Company formed in 1602. These two companies often paid dividends, or yearly profits of 50% to stockholders.</p>
<p class="indent">European governments adopted new ways to control trade that would increase their profits. These new methods and their justifications were called ‘Mercantilism’. The main goal was to sell more goods to other countries than a nation bought from other countries. To control the flow of foreign goods or imports into its country, the home government charged high tariffs. This added to the cost of foreign goods and discouraged the home people from buying them.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Commercial Revolution</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Meant by Commercial Revolution?</b></i></span> During the period 1500&ndash;1750, the world witnessed the spawning of a large intercontinental trade. Prior to 1500, spices, silk, precious stones, perfumes, etc., were transported from Asia to Europe by Italian and Arab merchants. This limited luxury trade grew, by the middle of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century into a massive trade based on the exchange of new and bulky necessities. Atlantic commerce became especially enormous, since the ‘New World’ plantations produced vast quantities of coffee, sugar, tobacco and other commodities sold in Europe. The plantations, in turn, had to import all their necessities such as grain, fish cloth and metal products since they were monoculture plantations growing only one commodity. Labour, too, had to be imported by these plantations. This led to a booming triangle trade&mdash;rum, cloth, guns and other metal products from Europe to Africa; slaves from Africa to the New World; and sugar, tobacco, coffee and bullion from the New World to Europe.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-263" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00134.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Take Place?</b></i></span> Trade with Asia too spawned during this period, though it did not equal the trade with the Americas. This was mainly because the European textile industries opposed the import of cotton goods from Asian countries. Foreign cottons, especially Indian, were popular in Europe as they were light, bright, inexpensive, and washable. They began to be imported in large quantities and objections were raised by native textile workers and by those who feared that national security was endangered by the loss of the bullion that was spent to pay for textiles. Pressure mounted on the respective government to secure the passage of laws for bidding or reducing the import of Indian cotton. Another reason was the difficulty in finding something that could be sold in the Asian market. Asia was uninterested in European goods, and Europe was reluctant to send bullion to pay for the Asian produce it wanted. This was a conundrum Europe could not solve until the development of power machinery at the end of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century when Europe began to make cheaper fabric than was available in Asia.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Triangular Trade</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-264" class="calibre10"></a>The mid-18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century witnessed the birth of a new commercial world which had been in the crucible since the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century when the European-dominated world commerce began. It carried further the shift of economic gravity from Southern to North-Western Europe, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Antwerp, the great commercial centre of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, collapsed in a few decades and was replaced by Amsterdam and London in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. In each case, an important trade based on a well-populated hinterland provided profits for diversification into manufacturing industry, services and banking. The baton of banking supremacy of the medieval Italian cities passed on in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century to the Germans and then, in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, to bankers in Holland and England. The bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of England were international economic forces in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Other merchant houses and banks clustered around them, undertaking operations of credit and finance. Interest rates came down and the bill of exchange, a medieval invention, underwent an enormous extension of use and became the primary financial instrument of international trade.</p>
<p class="indent">The 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century saw the beginning of an increasing use of paper money, instead of metallic currency. The first European paper currencies and cheques were born and joint-stock companies generated another from of negotiable security, their own shares. The London Stock Exchange was founded and by the late 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century such an institution existed in many other countries. New capital mobilisation schemes proliferated in London, Amsterdam and Paris. Lotteries too were popular for a while as were some spectacularly disastrous investment schemes. Despite this, the European world was growing more commercial, more used to the idea of employing money to make more money and was developing itself into a modern capitalist economy.</p>
<p class="indent">Occasionally, the interplay of commercial development seems to have thrown light on changes with deep implications. An example of this came when a 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century English financier for the first time offered life insurance to the public. There had already begun the practice of selling annuities on a man’s life. What was new was the application of actuarial science and the newly available statistics of political arithmetic to this business. A reasonable calculation, instead of a bet, was now possible on a mater of hitherto absolute uncertainty, viz. death. With increasing refinement men went on to offer protection from a range of disasters, at a price, of course. This was also, incidentally, another very important device for the mobilisation of wealth in large amounts for further investments. The timing of the discovery of life insurance at this time also suggests that the dimensions of economic change are sometimes very far-reaching indeed.</p>
<p class="indent">West Europe’s most impressive structural development in commerce was the sudden new importance of overseas trade from the second half of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century onwards. This was part of the shift of economic activity from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic observable even before 1500. In the late 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, though the closed trade of Spain and Portugal with their transatlantic colonies was important, overseas trade was dominated by the Dutch &ndash; the first great maritime trading nation &ndash; and their increasingly successful rivals, the English. Dutch commerce grew out of the supply of salted herrings to European markets and the possession of a particularly suitable bulk-carrying vessel, the fly-boat. With this the Dutch dominated the important Baltic trade from whose mastery they advanced to become the carriers of Europe. They were <a id="calibre_link-265" class="calibre10"></a>gradually displaced by the English in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, though they continued to maintain a vast network of colonies and trading stations, especially in the Far East. The English were the supreme masters in the Atlantic region and fish played an important role in this. The English caught the extremely nutritious and, therefore, valuable cod on the Newfoundland shore, dried and salted it ashore and then sold it in Mediterranean countries where fish was in great demand because of the practice of fasting on Fridays. Gradually, both Dutch and English diversified their trade and became dealers themselves. France was not to be left behind either, and her overseas trade doubled in the first half of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century saw the contours of an oceanic economy emerging. The trade to the Far East, which had been opened by the Portuguese, was soon being profitably exploited by the English, Dutch and French. The Spanish were involved in the Atlantic. By 1700, an international trading community came into existence which did business round the globe and in which slave trade played a key role. Most slaves were of black African stock, the first batch of whom were shipped across the Atlantic to Brazil, the Caribbean colonies and British settlements on the North American mainland. This slave trade, based on the buying of Africans from other Africans by the English, Dutch and French and their sale to other Europeans and the Americans, is a phenomenon whose repercussions have carried much further than the enslavement of Europeans by Ottomans or Africans by Arabs.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Outcome?</b></i></span> The first and foremost outcome of this development in trade was that, for the first time, international division of labour was achieved on a significant scale. The world economy was gradually but surely emerging as a single unit. The Americas produced raw materials, Africa the manpower, Asia an assortment of luxury products, and Western Europe conducted these global operations and concentrated increasingly on industrial output.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00047.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Dutch Trade Routes</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-266" class="calibre10"></a>The demands of the new global economy raised the issue of supplying sufficient labour force to the regions producing raw materials. The New World plantations met this by importing African slaves. African populations are most numerous today, for this reason, precisely in those areas that had formerly been devoted to plantation agriculture &ndash; the Southern United States, Northern Brazil and the West Indies. The early Europeans’ solution to their labour needs was to leave a bitter legacy. To the present day, these are areas besieged by racial discrimination and underdevelopment problems dating back to the colonial period. The racial conflict in American ghettos and Caribbean Islands is the result of over four centuries of slave trade. Likewise, the underdevelopment of Latin America is a continuation of the economic dependency of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies on Western Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">The greatest effect of the new advances in trade was felt in Africa. Over 12 million slaves were transported to the New World. The real horror of the slave trade was in the fact that approximately four times as many Africans were captured in the African interior than eventually arrived in the Americas. This amounted to a drain of 48 million people from Africa, almost all of them in the prime of life, and 36 million casualties were sustained in the course of the overland marches from the interior to the coast and then during the dreadful trans-atlantic crossings.</p>
<p class="indent">The effect of the slave trade varied from one part of Africa to another. East Africa and Angola suffered severely because their populations were relatively small to begin with, and their economies, near the subsistence level. For them, the depletion in population was devastating. In contrast, West Africa did not suffer so ruinously since it was more populated and economically advanced, so the devastation of slavery had a lesser effect. On the African continent, as a whole however, the effect on the population was not as great as might be expected because the slaves were taken over a period from 1450 to 1870 and from a total sub-Saharan population estimated at 70&ndash;80 million. Nonetheless, the slave trade had an unsettling and corrosive effect on the entire Africa coast from Senegal to Angola and for 400 to 500 miles inland. The appearance of the European slave traders with their cargo of guns and hardware set off a chain reaction of slave hunting and raids into the African interiors. Wars became frequent among groups vying for control of the lucrative and militarily decisive trade.</p>
<p class="indent">The least affected among all the continents by the activity of this period was Asia, as it was adequately strong militarily, politically and economically to avoid subjugation. In fact, most of Asia was quite unaware of the persistent and annoying European merchants appearing on their coast at this time. Only a few coastal areas in India and some islands of the East Indies felt the impact of Europe’s early economic expansion. So far as Asia as a whole was concerned, its attitude was best expressed by the Chinese Emperor, Chien-lung, who replied to a message from King George III of England in 1793 asking for the establishment of diplomatic and commercial relations: “As your ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country’s manufactures.”</p>
<p class="indent">The Commercial Revolution had its greatest effect on Europe and the effects of the new global economy for it were all positive. The Europeans were pioneer middlemen of world trade. They were the ones to open new trade routes and supply necessary capital, shipping and technical skills, so it was natural that they should have profited most. Some of the benefits trickled down to the European masses, as indicated by the fact that when tea was introduced in England in 1650 it was a costly item, <a id="calibre_link-267" class="calibre10"></a>but in a century it became an article of common consumption.</p>
<p class="indent">More than the effect on the living standards in Europe, the important effect was the stimulus European economy got from the new global commerce. The Industrial Revolution of the late 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, for instance, owes much to the capital earned from overseas enterprises and to the growing demand for European manufactures in overseas markets.</p>
<p class="indent">This was the period, then, that Europe got the boost it needed to forge ahead in the ascent to global economic primacy. The overall results were positive, because global division of labour led to increased productivity. The world was richer in 1750 than it was in 1500, and the economic growth has been sustained to the present day. Sadly, North-Western Europe has received, as the world’s entrepreneur, most of the benefits at the expense of other regions and this was an extremely heavy price to pay. The current conflict of races, the gross discrepancy between rich and poor nations and the scars of slavery are reminders of the toll European prosperity has exacted on the world.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Mercantilism</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Mercantilism?</b></i></span> The period between 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and the middle of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century has been characterised as the Mercantile era. During the period, the theory of Mercantilism developed along with the growth of modern nationstates. In the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, people like Hobbes and William Petty popularised the notion of ‘absolutism’. According to them, a modern nation-state should develop an international trade of a specific sort which would ensure the flow of bullion from other countries to it, while preventing the flow of bullion from it to other countries. This theory was called ‘Crude Bullionism’. In the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, however, an important change came in the doctrine of Mercantilism. Great emphasis began to be put on the importance of maintaining an excess of exports over imports so that a country without gold or silver mines could obtain a continuous net inflow of the precious metals which were regarded as essential to the national wealth and strength. This was so basically due to the widely held opinion in those days that the sum of prosperity in the world was constant and the aim of commercial policy was to secure for each nation the largest possible slice of the cake. This aim of commercial policy of a nation was expressed in such features as the customs and the navigation laws.</p>
<p class="indent">The essentials of Mercantilism can be listed as follows:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">1.</b></span>A policy should be framed and executed in strictly nationalistic terms.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">2.</b></span>In appraising any relevant element of national policy or foreign trade, great weight is always to be put on its effect on the national stock of precious metals.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">3.</b></span>In the absence of domestic gold or silver mines, a primary national goal should be attained of a large excess of exports over imports whereby the national stock of precious metals can be augmented.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">4.</b></span>A balance of trade in favour of one’s country is to be sought through direct promotion by the authorities of exports and restriction of imports or by measures which will operate indirectly in these directions.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">5.</b></span>Economic and political foreign policies are to be pursued with constant attention to both plenty and power, as national objectives, each capable of being used as means to the attainment of the other.</p>
<p class="indent">Mercantilism was, therefore, a doctrine of state intervention in economic life, but of state interventionism of a special pattern and with some special objectives. It was in sharp contrast with the <i class="calibre8">laissez faire</i> doctrine and with some present day systems of state interventionism, such as socialism, communism and welfare <a id="calibre_link-268" class="calibre10"></a>state. In principle at least these do not have the accumulation of the precious metals, favourable balance of trade, etc., as central and ultimate objectives.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was Mercantalism Affected?</b></i></span> The modern nation-states, after their political consolidation, began to consolidate their economies by intervention. In the first place, economic consolidation was brought about by the establishment of state monopoly over gun-powder industry. Secondly, it was brought about by exempting certain industries and groups from taxes. The moderate policy of the Dutch Republic towards the Jews and their industries is a good case in point. Third type of intervention was the establishment of state-owned guilds to supply goods to the state. The saddle-makers in England, for instance, were asked to provide the Royal Cavalry with saddles. All these developments took place in England under the Tudors during the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. In France these took place a little later, i.e., in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century in the form of the famous ‘Colbertain laws’. England, France and Holland were to be followed soon by other West European countries.</p>
<p class="indent">Though there were no major changes in the industrial organisation during the Mercantile era, some minor changes did take place. So far as technology is concerned, it virtually remained the same but for two changes, viz., the substitution of coal for wood as fuel and the improvement of ships and boats along with canals. The former was the result of improvement in the technology of mining. For example, the invention of improved pumps improved the drainage system early in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, which in turn encouraged the sinking of mines to greater depth. The latter facilitated the transportation of bulk goods easily and also cheaply. With the introduction of gunpowder and cannons, travel by sea also became safer than before.</p>
<p class="indent">In the market also there were some important changes. The demand for goods from the newly discovered lands, from the new bourgeoisie and the old aristocracy and also from the increasing urban population, all contributed to the expansion of both internal and external market. As a result, the old European handicraft and artisan industries received a boost.</p>
<p class="indent">Though the changes in technology did not change the pattern of production to any considerable extent, the changes in the market did effect some changes in the industrial organisation, like the introduction of the ‘putting-out’ system or the ‘Verlag’ system. In this system, the merchant is at the centre of the circle and is connected with different artisans. A cloth merchant, for instance, has connections with the spinners, weavers, dyers, etc. This kind of organisation leads to a division of labour or specialisation, and an increase in the production as well as in the dependence of the artisans on the merchant. Though in this system, the primary producer still possesses the means of production (because technology is not yet complicated), he increasingly becomes dependent on the merchant. This is the crucial difference between the old system and the new system.</p>
<p class="indent">According to Karl Marx, there are two types of ‘putting-out’ merchants, viz., rich artisans and pure merchants. In his opinion, if an artisan becomes a putting-out merchant, it is ‘path-one’; if a pure merchant becomes a putting-out merchant, it is ‘path-two’. To Marx, ‘path-one’ is the real revolutionary way, and it is the most popular one. But this point is doubtful. Since the ‘putting-out’ system was risky, the rich artisans usually did not take up the role of putting out merchants except in some cases. We have to keep in mind the fact that it was not at all very easy for a rich artisan to become a putting-out merchant, just as it was not for a journeyman to become a master-artisan.</p>
<p class="indent">Capital growth in the Mercantile era and the early Industrial period, according to Weber and his followers, took place along with cultural and <a id="calibre_link-269" class="calibre10"></a>social growth. According to their theory, with the spread of Protestantism, people developed a desire to save something and this led to some kind of capital accumulation. But according to some others, such as E.J. Hamilton, the clue to the growth of capital during the Industrial Revolution lay in the contacts between the New World and the Old World, i.e., in the flow of bullion from the newly discovered countries into Europe. In the Marxian concept, however, accumulation of capital means a transfer as well as a concentration of the ownership of titles to wealth into the hands of the bourgeois class.</p>
<p class="indent">The various ways in which a class may increase its ownership of property can be reduced to two main categories. First, this class may purchase property from its former owners in exchange, for the means of immediate consumption or enjoyment. Secondly, the bourgeoisie may acquire a particular sort of property when this happens to be exceptionally cheap, and realise this property at some later period when the market value of this property stands relatively high in exchange for other things such as labour power or industrial equipment which stand at a relatively lower valuation. Some influence is required here to depress the value of whatever happened to be the object of hoarding by the bourgeoisie during the phase of acquisition and enhance its value during the phase of realisation. It might occur as a result of a deliberate policy of the state, or it might occur as an incident in the break-up of an old order of society, which would tend to have the double effect of impoverishing and weakening those associated with the old mode of production and affording the bourgeoisie an opportunity of gaining some means of political power. In the case of the 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century England, the new bourgeoisie was able to purchase land from both large feudal landowners and certain sections of smaller ones. Here force of circumstances in the form of economic distress and overt pressure are often merged. However, the same thing is not applicable to the Continental countries because the happenings there are different from those of England.</p>
<p class="indent">During the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, money came to be of major importance to a rapidly growing number of people, yet simultaneously ready money became scarce. This was because there was a vast growth of the European economy and the various new and expanded economic activities (such as the emergence of new industries, the intensification of land use, the growth of trade, etc.) required money. Though there was a substantial increase in Europe’s monetary stock due to the exploitation of silver mines of Europe and the inflow of bullion from Americas, it was not sufficient to meet the rapidly rising demand for means of payment. The letters and papers of merchants and ministers give us enough evidence to show that there was ‘scarcity of coin’ and the ’want of money’. Almost all financial centres, except perhaps Amsterdam, suffered temporary monetary inanition. This experience stimulated several innovations. Various attempts were made to transact business without resorting to gold and silver. The introduction of copper currency was one of them, but copper was suitable for only small denominations.</p>
<p class="indent">For large transactions, the only solution was to use ‘credit instruments’, such as loans, securities, bonds, credit transfers paper money and negotiable obligations. All these were employed on an increasing scale to avoid the use of precious metals. By 1730, the widespread use of credit was a feature of almost every European country. In some areas, indeed, a sophisticated and inter-locking system of multilateral commercial payments, controlled and secure credit, etc., grew, making it impossible to increase the monetary stock of Europe.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-33"><a id="calibre_link-270" class="calibre10"></a><b class="calibre9">INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION: SCIENTIFIC &amp; TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION; ENGLISH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION &amp; ITS IMPACT</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The years from 1760 to 1870 may be called the period of the first stage of Industrial Revolution, a period that changed manufacturing processes from slow, expensive hand production to faster, cheaper machine production. From 1870 onwards, we have the second stage of the Industrial Revolution which was characterised by the direct application of science to industry and by the development of mass production techniques. The Revolution began in England as a result of its need to fulfil growing demands for goods, both at home and abroad. England had the capital, or money to invest, the natural resources, and the labour supply to make the goods &ndash; but she needed better methods of production.</p>
<p class="indent">The textile, or cloth-making industry, was the first to experience the revolution. The demand for cotton cloth became so great that the old methods could not keep up, and many people began inventing cotton weaving machinery. One invention led to the need for others to keep production going, and step by step the textile industry underwent great advances. The revolution spread with the invention of better machines, new factories, use of steam, and increased output of coal and iron.</p>
<p class="indent">The steam engine advanced by steps and took an important place in industry. In the 1600s, Thomas Savery invented a steam pump to remove the water from mines. In 1705, Thomas Newcomen patented an early steam engine which was improved and patented by James Watt in 1769. By 1785, Watt’s engine was used in cotton mills and other factories. Factories with steam engines were now free to locate anywhere; they were no longer dependent on a fast river or waterfall for power.</p>
<p class="indent">The cotton industry was by no means the only one which benefitted from the new spirit of invention and enterprise. More effective methods were discovered for manufacturing woollen goods and fabrics of various descriptions; the old method of smelting iron by means of charcoal was abandoned and the coal and iron industries which had up to this time been of comparatively little importance made much progress that they eventually became the chief industries of England; and finally, means of communications (roads, canals and bridges) were improved. In 1804, the first locomotive was made, and in 1830 the first passenger railway (between Liverpool and Manchester) was opened. After railways multiplied, and by the middle of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century there was a network of them over Europe as well as England. The steam boat preceded the steam engine as a means of locomotion. Steam boat came in 1802 and in 1819, a steam boat crossed the Atlantic from Savannah to Liverpool, taking just 25 days for the voyage.</p>
<p class="indent">Still more wonderful, perhaps, were the inventions which arose from the investigations of Faraday and others into the properties and uses of electricity. In 1835, the first electric telegraph came into existence and 16 years later, the first undersea cable was laid between England and France. In few years, the telegraph system spread throughout the civilised world and news which had travelled slowly from place to place could be flashed with incredible speed from one end of the earth to other.</p>
<p class="indent">The improvements which had originated in England took firm and rapid roots in other countries too, until all the great nations of the earth were thoroughly industrialised. In a space of about 100 years, the world had been transformed. If it had been possible for a Roman of the times of Caesar to come to life in England or in France about the year 1750 he would have found little to surprise him in the industrial methods of the people. But if he had come to life a hundred years later (1850) he would <a id="calibre_link-271" class="calibre10"></a>have found himself in an altogether unfamiliar world with its busy cities, its factories full of complicated machinery, and its astonishing development of methods of communication.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Scientific and Technological Revolution</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Causes?</b></i></span> Several ancient civilisations of the East are said to be the cradles of scientific thought. The scientific and technological revolution is, however, a unique product of Western civilisation. This is perhaps because science became a part of daily life in the Western society. Or, to say it differently, only in the West were the philosopher, scientist and artisan united so they stimulated each other. It was this union of science and society or scientist and artisan that contributed greatly to the unprecedented blossoming of science in the Western world.</p>
<p class="indent">Artisans through the ages of all civilisations developed certain skills and through their observation and experiments gradually improved their techniques which occasionally reached very high levels. The degree of success achieved by pre-modern societies was limited, as the artisans were interested in improving their technical skill without bothering to go into the chemical or mechanical principles underlying certain natural phenomena or products. They did not question the relationship between cause and effect. The artisans thus concerned themselves with the technological knowledge rather than scientific explanations.</p>
<p class="indent">At certain periods of history, scientists and artisans did work together to produce mechanical aids, but the fact remains that until recent times, the tendency was towards compartmentalisation. The contribution of the West lay in bringing them together. This fusion gave science the impetus that was to make it the dominant force that it is today.</p>
<p class="indent">The question arises as to why did this unique development took place in the West? One reason was the humanistic scholarship of the Renaissance scholars and artists and access to a wide variety of thought and studies. There was also the impetus that was given by the biological sciences. The favourable social atmosphere in Western Europe was another factor in the development of scientific thought in the West. In these times, the gulf between scientist and artisan was bridged. Artisans were no longer the despised lot of the classical and medieval times. In this age of renaissance (rebirth), respect was given to the practical arts of spinning, weaving, ceramics, glass making and, most importantly, to mining and metallurgy. All these crafts in Renaissance Europe were in the hands of freemen rather than slaves as in classical times. The freemen were not at such a great social and economic distance from the ruling classes as they were in classical ages. The higher status of the Renaissance artist allowed him to strengthen his ties with the scholar. Each had a role to play and contributions to make. The artisan added new skills and devices evolved during the Middle Ages to antique skills. Scholars produced new facts, speculations, and procedures of rediscovered antiquity and of medieval science. The two approaches fused slowly to produce an explosive combination.</p>
<p class="indent">An offshoot of this convergence of scientific and artistic thoughts was the union of physical labour and thought that was brought about by individual scholars. There was strong prejudice, in the ancient times, against combining creative pursuit with manual work. This prejudice which arose perhaps from the association of manual work with slavery, continued in medieval Europe long after slavery disappeared. Medieval philosophers drew a distinction between work done by the mind alone and work that involved a change in matter. Poets, mathematicians and logicians belonged to the first category while sculptors, glaziers, iron workers belonged to the second. This attitude led to the stalling of progress until a balance was struck between the two.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-272" class="calibre10"></a>The discoveries of explorers and the opening up of new lands across the seas gave an added stimulus to the progress of science. New plants, animals, human beings and human societies were discovered, challenging ideas and assumptions held unchanged for centuries. The growth of commerce and industry led to technological advances which, in turn, were stimulated by science. Oceanic trade created an enormous demand for the ship-building industry and navigation. A new class of mathematically trained craftsmen began to make compasses, maps and other navigational instruments. Navigation schools were founded in Portugal, Spain, Holland and France and astronomy was studied seriously for its obvious utilitarian value.</p>
<p class="indent">The needs of the mining industry led to the invention of pumps and advances in power transmission. This marked the beginning of a new interest in mechanical and hydraulic principles. In a similar manner, metallurgy was responsible for progress in chemistry. As mining operation progressed new ores and even new metals like zinc and cobalt were discovered. Techniques had to be found to separate and handle them as well as refine them. In doing, so a general theory of chemistry began to take shape, involving oxidations and reductions, distillations and amalgamations. The new knowledge in all these fields was both circulated and stimulated by universities and printing press. The latter was especially important in the spread of new ideas and in the promotion of literacy.</p>
<p class="indent">Science initially received much more from the mine and workshop than it could contribute. At this stage, science was not an integral part of economic and social life and was used sporadically and sparingly. This was the case until the early stages of the industrial revolution in the late 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and early 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries. But by the end of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, things changed and science began to play an active role in society transforming old industries and even creating new ones.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Take Place?</b></i></span> How did science change social and economic life so radically in such a short while? The first major advance of modern science and technology occurred in the field of astronomy which was closely related to geography and navigation. This scientific leap was achieved in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, and the great names were Minolaj Kopernik or Copernicus (1473&ndash;1543), Galileo Galilee (1564&ndash;1642) and Isaac Newton (1642&ndash;1727). Copernicus took up the idea of some ancient philosophers that the sun, rather than the earth, was the centre of the universe and said that this provided a simpler explanation for the movements of the heavenly bodies than did the traditional Ptolemaic system. Galileo discovered the telescope which enabled men to see what actually was in the heavens thus giving empirical support to Copernicus theory.</p>
<p class="indent">The most outstanding figure of early science is Newton, a towering genius who in addition to his pioneering works in optics, hydrodynamics and mathematics, discovered the laws of gravitation. With this revolutionary explanation, Newton proved that a fundamental cosmic law existed which could be proved mathematically and applied to all matter. Nature indeed appeared at this time to be a gigantic mechanical object operating according to natural laws that could be found by observation, experiment and calculation. All branches of human knowledge could be broken down into simple uniform laws that rational persons could discover. People began to apply the analytical method of Newtonian physics to the entire field of thought and knowledge, to human society as well as to the physical universe.</p>
<p class="indent">When the Industrial Revolution got underway in the late 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, it affected and was affected by the Scientific Revolution. The development of the steam engine is an <a id="calibre_link-273" class="calibre10"></a>example. It provided the power needed to pump water out of mines. Using scientific knowledge and technical ingenuity, James Watt improved the steam engine to a reasonable level of efficiency. If the relatively unlimited power of the steam engine was not available, the Industrial Revolution may well have petered out. It might have amounted to a mere speed up in textile manufacturing as it happened in China where analogous technical advances were made centuries earlier.</p>
<p class="indent">The maximum progress was achieved in the field of chemistry during the first half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century partly because of its links with the then rapidly growing textile industry. A significant achievement in chemistry comparable to Newton’s theory of gravitation was Antoine Lavoisier’s (1743&ndash;1794) law of the conservation of matter.</p>
<p class="indent">Darwin was another dominant personality of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. He discovered what we call the Theory of Evolution. His doctrine of evolution holds that animal and vegetable species in their present diverse forms are not the fixed and unchangeable results to separate special acts of creation. They are different and are capable of change. They are the outcome of the common original source. He believed that the chief manner in which variation took place was by natural selection.</p>
<p class="indent">The details of Darwin’s theories have been modified by later research, but his basic premise of evolution is accepted by all scientists now. However, when Darwin first let the world to know about his theory, there was bitter opposition from some quarters, especially the clergy. This was understandable since Darwin was denying the act of divine creation. Just as Copernicus deposed earth from its central place in the universe, Darwin seemed to dethrone human beings from their central place in the history of the earth.</p>
<p class="indent">Darwinism had a profound impact on the Western society despite the hostile reception from religious and conservative groups. Its emphasis on survival of the fittest and struggle for survival fitted in with the temper of the times. In politics, Bismarck was unifying Germany by blood and iron. Nationalistic admirers in all countries believed that Darwinism offered them support and justification. They held that in politics as in nature, the strongest are victorious and that war-like qualities decide who will win the international struggle for survival. In economic life, this was the period of free enterprise and rugged individualism. The upper and middle classes who were comfortably off stoutly opposed any intervention by the state for the promotion of greater social and economic justice. They used Darwinism to <a id="calibre_link-274" class="calibre10"></a>their advantage saying they deserved their prosperity because they had proved themselves ‘fitter’ than the ‘worthless’ poor. The absorption of smaller firms by bigger ones was justified by the same measure.</p>

<p class="indent">The late 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century was a time of rapid colonial expansion and, here too Darwinism was used to justify imperialism. The argument was that great powers needed colonies for their prosperity and survival. Further the argument said that native people, judged in terms of worldly success were weak, inferior and in need of protection and guidance from the superior and stronger Europeans.</p>
<p class="indent">This kind of application of Darwin’s theory to social science is known as Social Darwinism. Darwin himself perhaps never dreamt, let alone intended, that his findings would be exploited in this fashion. The fact remains that they were, for the simple reason that they seemed to offer scientific support for the materialism that was spreading over Europe at this time.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Significance?</b></i></span> By the close of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>century, science and technology became an integral part of Western society. From the peripheral role in the beginning of the century in the socio-economic life of Europe, science was soon playing a central role, making crucial contributions to the old established industries. At the end of the century, it was creating new industries, and was profoundly affecting the way of thinking and lifestyle in the West. The affects of science had far-reaching impact on the world in both direct and indirect ways.</p>
<p class="indent">The Scientific Revolution made Europe’s domination of the world technologically possible, and determined to a large extent the nature and affects of this domination. It also provided the basis for the intellectual domination of the West. While the East was able to hold its own in art, religion and philosophy, it was unable to stand up to this scientific thought and principles of natural science. Only the West had mastered the secrets of nature and had exploited them for material advancement. The world recognised the importance of Europe’s scientific and technological revolution. In the modern day, the aim of most former colonial peoples is to experience this unique revolution themselves.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">English Industrial Revolution &amp; its Impact</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Industrial Revolution?</b></i></span> The term Industrial Revolution is used to describe the radical changes that took place in Europe, mainly England, in the latter half of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, changing a primarily agricultural country into an industrial one. However, the term is used to describe a ‘revolution’ that began before the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and, for all practical purposes, has continued to the present day. Obviously then, this was not a revolution in the sense of a spectacular change that began and ended suddenly.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet the fact remains that during the 1780s, a breakthrough did occur in productivity. More specifically, a mechanised factory system was created that produced goods in vast quantities and at rapidly falling prices, so it was no longer dependent on existing demand, but could create its own demand. An example of this is the now common but hitherto unknown phenomenon, the automobile industry. It was not the demand for automobiles which created the giant automobile industry today but the capacity to build cheap models, in large quantities, and the consequent mass demand for them.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Take Place in England?</b></i></span> Why is it that the Industrial Revolution took place in England in the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century alone and not a few hundred years before or after? The answer lies to a large extent in the remarkable economic growth achieved by England in particular and Europe, in general, following the Commercial Revolution.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-275" class="calibre10"></a>The Commercial Revolution contributed to the industrial revolution in several important ways. Firstly, it provided large and expanding markets for European products like textiles, firearms, ships and naval accessories such as sails, anchors, pulleys and nautical instruments. In order to meet the demand of these new markets, industries had to improve their technology and organisation. The Commercial Revolution also contributed large amounts of capital necessary to finance the construction of factories and machines for the Industrial Revolution. The capital in the form of profits poured into Europe from all corners of the globe. Thus the combination of profitable commercial enterprise, technological growth and institutional change helped the Industrial Revolution take off in the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="indent">This leads us to the next question. Why was it England that happened to be the place of initial take off? An important advantage England enjoyed was that it had taken an early lead in the basic industries of coal and iron. England began using coal for heating and for smelting iron very early because its forests were being depleted very rapidly. By the time of French Revolution, England was producing about ten million tons of coal every year, while France was producing 700,000 tonnes. England, also pioneered the development of the blast furnace, which could in the contrast to the old forges, mass-produce iron. This meant that England was forging ahead in the production of goods for mass consumption, goods for which there was a ready and growing market. France, on the other hand, specialised more in luxury items of limited and fluctuating demand.</p>
<p class="indent">An additional advantage England had was the fluid capital available for the financing of the industrial revolution. More profits from commerce poured into England than any other country. The English court and military expenditure were lower than the French costs so that English taxation was lighter. Government finances too were in a better condition in England. Banking developed earlier and more efficiently in England providing pooled funds for individual and corporate enterprises.</p>
<p class="indent">Noteworthy also was the impressive managerial talent available in England. This is to be explained in part by outstanding contributions of non-conformists like the Darbys in the iron industry, the Brights in cotton milling and politics and Dalton and Eddington in science. The stress on personal responsibility and freedom from convention produced, among the non-conformists, a disproportionate number of experimenters and inventors, while their frugality led them to plough profits back into business rather than to squander them in luxuries.</p>
<p class="indent">Mobile and plentiful supply of labour was also an advantage England had over other countries. This supply of labour was made possible by earlier disintegrations of the guilds and by the enclosing of traditional strips of farmlands. The end of the guilds with their manifold restrictions made it easier to introduce the puttingout system to equip factories with power machinery. The land enclosures began in the 1500s and continued for three centuries. The small peasants were frequently forced to sell out because the enclosing of common and waste lands left them no land for grazing and fuel. The earlier enclosures were due to the rising price of wool, so that the land was used mostly for grazing. In the later period, the need to grow food for the rapidly growing cities was more important. So the enclosed land was cultivated according to the most efficient and up-to-date methods.</p>
<p class="indent">Land enclosure was an unsettling and unpleasant process, but as far as the Industrial Revolution was concerned, it fulfilled two essential functions&mdash;it provided labour for factories and food for cities. For this reason, the enclosures may be considered a pre-requisite to England’s industrial supremacy in <a id="calibre_link-276" class="calibre10"></a>the early days. Enclosures took place in some other European countries too, but to a far lesser extent. In France, for example, the French Revolution provided peasants with more land, thereby reinforcing their attachment to their birthplaces and their unwillingness to leave.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Take Place in Engand?</b></i></span> Necessity is the mother of invention&mdash; this is an oft repeated saying which has been proved right often in the history of humankind. Inventors rarely invent without a strong stimulus&mdash;that of demand. Many of the principles that the new inventions of the industrial revolution were based on were known long before the 18th century, but were not applied to industry because a strong incentive was lacking. This was the case, for instance, with steam power. Although known in Hellenistic Egypt it was used merely to open and close temple doors. In 18th century England, when a new source of power was urgently needed to pump out water from mines and turn the wheels of new machinery, a series of inventions and improvements took place which led to the development of a commercially practical steam engine.</p>
<p class="indent">The pattern of demand leading to invention is plainly evident in the course of the Industrial Revolution. Inventions in one field created an imbalance and stimulated counter inventions in other fields. The cotton industry, for instance, was the first to be mechanised because cotton goods, originally imported from India, had become very popular with the English people. In fact, cotton was used so widely that the old and powerful woollen interests secured the passage of a law in 1700 prohibiting the importation of cotton textiles. The law, however, did not ban the manufacture of cotton cloth. This created an opportunity for local industry, and enterprising middlemen were soon exploiting it. The problem now was how to speed up the spinning and weaving enough to meet the demand of the large home market. Prizes were offered for inventions that would increase output and, by 1830 a series of such inventions had completely mechanised the cotton industry.</p>
<p class="indent">Among the outstanding inventions were John Key’s flying shuttle (1773) which speeded up weaving; Richard Arkwright’s water frame (1769) which spun fine strong yarn between rollers; James Hargreave’s spinning jenny (1770) on which one person could spin eight, then 16, and finally over a 100 threads of yarn at once; and Samuel Crompton’s spinning mule (1779), so called because it combined features of the water frame and the jenny. All these new machines were soon producing far more thread than could be handled by the weavers. Edmund Cartright, therefore, tried to redress the balance by patenting in 1785 a power loom operated first by horses and after 1789 by steam. By 1820s the hand weavers in the cotton industry were supplanted by the power loom.</p>
<p class="indent">This response of inventions and counter inventions to balance each other was seen not only in spinning and weaving industries but in other areas as well. The inventions seem like a chain reaction&mdash;one invention sparking off another. For example, the new cotton machines created a demand for more plentiful and reliable power than provided by the traditional waterwheels and horses. The response to this need was James Watt’s multiple improvements on a primitive engine by Thomas Newcomen and by 1800, several Watt engines were in action; 33% of them pumping water and the remainder in supply of rotary power to textile mills, iron furnaces, flour mills and other industries.</p>
<p class="indent">This historical significance of the steam engine can scarcely be exaggerated. It provided a means of harnessing and utilising heat energy to furnish driving power for machines, thus ending this dependence on animal, wind and water power. With the availability of this vast new power, it was soon possible to tap the fossil fuels locked up in the bowels of the earth namely oil and gas. In this way began <a id="calibre_link-277" class="calibre10"></a>the trend that has led to enormous energy sources available to modern day industrialised nations.</p>
<p class="indent">The new machines of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century needed an increased supply of iron, steel and coal. This need was met by a series of improvements in mining and metallurgy&mdash;Abraham Darby’s substitution of coal for coke in smelting iron ore, Henry Cort’s puddling process for removing impurities in smelted iron and the use of Watt’s steam engine for operating ballows and hammers and for rolling and splitting. As a result of these developments, by 1800 England was producing more coal and iron than the rest of the world combined. Iron became cheap and abundant enough to be used for general construction purposes, and human society entered the Age of Iron as well as the Age of Steam.</p>
<p class="indent">A consequence of the expansion in the textile, mining and metallurgical industries was the need for improved transportation facilities to move bulky shipments of coal and ore. This led to a boom in canal building in England which was paralleled by a great period of road building. After 1750, a group of road engineers&mdash;Town Metcalf, Thomas Telfore and John Mac Adam&mdash;developed methods of building hard surface roads that would bear traffic throughout the year. After 1830 both roads and waterways faced a challenge from the rail road, whose inventor, George Stephenson, was a marine engineer. In 1830, his steam engine ‘Rocket’ pulled a train 31 miles from Liverpool to Manchester at an average speed of 14 miles per hour. Within a few years, the railroad dominated long distance traffic, for it could move passengers and freight faster and more cheaply than was possible by canal or road. The steam engine was also applied to water transportation. The pioneer was Robert Fulton who, in 1807, launched his ‘Clemont’ on the Hudson River. By 1833, the ‘Royal William’ steamed from Nova Scotia to England, and five years later, the ‘Sirius’ and the ‘Great Western’ crossed the Atlantic in the opposite direction. In 1840, Samuel Cunard established a regular transatlantic service, announcing before hand, dates of arrival and departure.</p>
<p class="indent">The industrial revolution was a revolution in communication as well. Hitherto a message could be sent to a distant place only by wagon, post rider or boat. But in the middle of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the electric telegraphy was invented and, in 1866 a transatlantic cable was laid, establishing instant communication between the Old and New Worlds.</p>
<p class="indent">But it would be wrong to assume that the Industrial Revolution was a 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century phenomenon ending with the rise of railroads or transatlantic steamships or telegraphic communication. It continues to the present day with certain discernible stages in its evolution. The first stage lasted to the middle of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and included the mechanisation of the cotton industry, of mining and of metallurgy, and the development of the steam engine and its application to industry and transportation. The second stage lasted through the latter part of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and was characterised by the more direct application of science to industry and by the development of mass production techniques. From playing a marginal role in industry at the beginning of the century, science became an integral part of all large industrial enterprises. A spectacular example of the practical applications of industrial research laboratories are the many coal derivatives that have been developed. Coal yield not only coke and a valuable gas used for illumination, it also gave liquid, or coal tar. Chemists discovered a veritable treasure trove in coal tar: dyes, aspirin, saccharin, disinfectants, perfumes, explosives, photographic chemicals, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">While Germany led the world in the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century in applying science to industry, the United States was the pioneer in developing mass production techniques. These were of two varieties. One was the making of standard interchangeable parts and assembling these parts into completed unit with minimum handicraft labour. The classic example is Henry Ford’s endless conveyor belt along which car parts travelled and were assembled by the workers who were transformed into cogs of the great production. The other technique was the manipulation of large masses of material by means of advanced mechanical devices as is done in the steel industry.</p>

<p class="caption">English Industrial Revolution</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-279" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Impact on Europe?</b></i></span> What was the impact of Industrial Revolution, which began in England, on the continent of Europe? Other countries too were growing in wealth and knowledge as was England and the impact was bound to be felt. The pattern of diffusion of the Industrial Revolution in Europe depended on various factors such as supply of natural resources and existence of a free and mobile working population, unencumbered by guild restrictions or feudal obligations. Belgium was the first country to be industrialised so that by 1870, majority of its population lived in cities and were directly dependent on trade or industry. France, Germany, Austria-Hungry, Italy and Russia soon followed suit. Meanwhile, non-European countries too were being industrialised; first the United States, then the British Dominions and Japan. Latecomers like USA and Germany had the advantage of beginning with newer and more efficient factories, so much so that England soon lost its original status as the industrial workshop of the world.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the effects of the Industrial Revolution in Europe was a further increase in population which had started earlier with the increased productivity in agriculture. Despite the emigration of millions of Europeans overseas during the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the European population in 1914 was three times that of 1750. This explosion had both medical and economic reasons. The substantial increase in productivity in agriculture and industry meant increased means of subsistence in terms of food, clothing, shelter and other necessities of life. Famine in most parts of Europe became a thing of the past. Even when crops failed, the new transportation facilities ensured supplies from outside.</p>
<p class="indent">Advances in medical science and the adoption of numerous public health measures also aided the spurt in population. While there was little or no increase in the birth rate, the death rate was sharply reduced by prevention or cure of diseases. Vaccination, isolation of patients with infectious diseases, safeguarding of water supplies, and knowledge of antiseptics &ndash; all served to reduce the death rate. Consequently, Europe’s population jumped from 140 million in 1750 to 463 million in 1914. This was a much higher percentage of increase than in other regions of the globe and led to an alteration in the global population balance.</p>
<p class="indent">Urbanisation was another effect of the Industrial Revolution. The size of cities had traditionally depended on the amount of food that the surrounding land could produce. Thus the most populous cities were located in valleys and food plains. With the Industrial Revolution and the factory system, the new industrial centres were flooded with people. Large new urban populations faced no such problems as the cities of the past. With food supplies from all over the world being available, there was no problem of food supplies to hinder the growth of cities.</p>
<p class="indent">Medical and technological advances removed the threat of plagues that previously used to threaten cities. Availability of pure water, perfecting of centralised sewerage and waste disposal systems, ensured supply of food, and prevention and control of contagious diseases made city living relatively endurable and pleasant. All over, the cities grew at a rapid pace and by 1930 they contained one-fifth of the world’s population. This is one of the most remarkable transformations in human history, for urban life was an entirely new way of life. By 1914 many Western countries, such as England, Belgium, Germany and the United States had a substantial majority of their people living in cities.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-280" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00060.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">Productivity at levels unprecedented in history were made possible by the industrial revolution with its efficient exploitation of human and natural resources on a worldwide scale. England, which was the first affected, increased its capital from 500 million pounds in 1750 to 6000 million in 1865. The entire world felt the impact of the increasing productivity in the latter part of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="indent">The distribution of wealth generated by the industrial revolution has been surrounded by controversy and debate, while one group holds that all classes benefited to a greater or lesser extent, the other maintains that a few made huge profits while the majority were ruthlessly exploited and suffered declining standards of living.</p>
<p class="indent">There was, without doubt, much exploitation and social disruption in the early days of industrialisation. Tenant farmers were dispossessed, and the weavers and other craftsmen were wiped out by the overwhelming competition from the new, cheaper, machine-made goods. These people faced the strain of moving to the city, finding employment and adjusting to an unfamiliar environment both at work and home. They were totally dependent on their employees for they had no land, no tools, no capital and no home of their own. They had become mere wage-earners with nothing to offer but their labour. They found the work tedious with 16 hours at work quite common. Worse than the long hours were the deplorable conditions in the factories, and the discipline and monotony of tending machines in a factory.</p>
<p class="indent">Wages were pitiably low as employers naturally regarded their wage bill as an expense that should be kept as low as possible. As a result, many of them, especially in the textile industry, preferred to employ women and <a id="calibre_link-281" class="calibre10"></a>children, who were willing to accept lower wages and were willing to follow orders. The exploitation of women and children reached such proportions that a parliamentary committee which conducted investigations found shocking conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">But these horrors did not stop labourers from the countryside crowding into the cities. They were so poorly paid in the country that they continued to stream into cities. The population of England rose during these early days of the Industrial Revolution; a fact that does not agree with the usual picture of the unending misery. It is quite possible that most of the workers in these early factories enjoyed higher real incomes than their ancestors. Though we cannot be sure of the affect of the industrial revolution on working class living standards in the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, we are quite certain that the standards rose substantially in the second half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The lower classes benefitted just as the upper classes did from the profits made from the huge overseas investments, though their benefits were relatively smaller.</p>
<p class="indent">The marked rise in national income did not mean, of course, that all classes benefitted equally. The proceeds of the general prosperity did trickle down, but they were mostly absorbed at the top. In England, for instance 4.93% of the people possessed over 60% of the wealth in 1911&ndash;1913. This meant there was a corresponding discrepancy in lifestyle too. The poor may no longer starve, but they lived in crowded tenements and subsisted on monotonous diets. In contrast, the middle classes could afford better living quarters and food, attend theatre and concert and educate their children. At the top, the wealthy lived in a style that was unimaginable to the masses at the bottom.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Impact on the Non-European World?</b></i></span> Since Europe’s Industrial Revolution was fuelled by the overseas trade, the revolution was bound to have its effect on the rest of the world too. Prior to 1763, European powers had only a few footholds in Asia and Africa. But, after this, they established political control over large parts of Asia and almost all of Africa. In the Americas and British Dominions, they were able to do much more than this. Taking advantage of the sparse populations in these regions, millions of Europeans emigrated filling up relatively empty spaces.</p>
<p class="indent">The Industrial Revolution was mainly responsible for mass migrations. The sharp increase in population created pressure on European resources leading to overseas migration. Railways and steamships were available to transport people across continents and overseas. Political and religious persecution also stimulated migrations as did disasters such as Ireland’s potato famine. The migrations from Europe reached proportions unprecedented in human history to that date.</p>
<p class="indent">The first wave of emigrations before 1885 took place from Northern and Western Europe. This was followed by emigrations from Southern and Eastern Europe. A rough pattern can be seen in the migration. Britishers mainly migrated to the Dominions and the United States, the Italians to the United Stated and Latin America, Germans to the United States, Spaniards and Portuguese to Latin America. Some Germans migrated to Argentina and Brazil, though this was a minor number. From the perspective of world history, this extraordinary migration is significant because it was all directed to the New World, with the exception of the rare flow to Asiatic Russia and the trickle to South Africa. The result has been Europeanisation of Siberia, the British Dominions excepting South Africa and Americas. The Indian population in Latin America barely managed to survive this onslaught and survived in a minority. This ethnic Europeanisation naturally and inevitably led to political, cultural and economic Europeanisation too.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-282" class="calibre10"></a>The creation of huge European colonial structures in Asia and Africa was the result of the Industrial Revolution. Called ‘New Imperialism’, the post-1870 empire building activities of European powers changed a large part of the earth’s surface into an appendage of a few European countries. The inter-relationship of the new imperialism and the Industrial Revolution was manifested in a growing desire to obtain colonies that would serve as markets for the rising volume of manufactured goods. Soon the industrialised countries were vying with each other for markets, in the process raising tariffs to keep out each other’s products. Soon, an argument was being put forward that each industrialised country must have colonies to provide “sheltered markets” for its manufacture.</p>
<p class="indent">The colonies served as investment outlets for the industrialised countries which had surplus capital. Colonies became an economic necessity. As more capital piled up at home, lower the profits fell, greater the need to find better investments in the first half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century made mostly in the Americas and Australia. But the trend changed in the latter half of the century and investments were made mostly in the relatively unstable countries of Asia and Africa. Thousands of small investors and large banking combinations in order to protect their investment in these countries preferred civilised administration&mdash;a euphemism for the exercise of European power. This led to the promotion of the new imperialism.</p>
<p class="indent">The Industrial Revolution also created a demand for raw materials to feed the machines. Many of these materials, jute, rubber, cotton, various metals, etc., came from the ‘uncivilised’ parts of the globe and needed heavy capital outlays for sustained production. This, in turn, led to the imposition of political control.</p>
<p class="indent">The last 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century saw an unprecedented phenomenon&mdash;the domination of the globe by one small part of the world. Not only did European powers own the vast colonial territories outright, they also dominated those economically and militarily weak areas that were not actually annexed by them. China, the Ottoman Empire and Persia were all nominally independent but were, in fact, constantly humiliated and controlled in various direct and indirect ways. Though military action in Latin America was discouraged by the Monroe doctrine, the area was merely an economic appendage of the great powers. Thus, Europe’s control extended not only over its far flung empires but also over the extensive dependent regions where more European capital was invested than in the colonies.</p>
<p class="indent">The massive European investments were safeguarded through various devices and pressures such as military missions that trained the local armed forces, financial missions that supervised and controlled local finances and extra-territorial and capitulatory arrangements that gave special privileges to Europeans residing or doing business in these regions. Thus, by 1914, most of the earth’s surface and population had come under direct or indirect domination of a few European countries, including Russia and the U.S.A.</p>

<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Industrialisation in the USA</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Background?</b></i></span> By the end of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the United States was experiencing many of the same trends and developments as other nations of Western civilisation. It was influenced by Enlightenment ideas, experienced a revolution, and established liberal political institutions&mdash;a pattern familiar to France and other European nations. With the exception of the black slaves, almost all citizens of the new nation were from European stock. Most people worked the land, but there were some growing <a id="calibre_link-283" class="calibre10"></a>cities and early industrial establishments&mdash;again a pattern not too different from many areas in Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">There were some important differences too between the United States and other nations of Western civilisation in 1800. It had only recently emerged from colonial status and remained separated from Europe by the Atlantic Ocean. Politically and socially, the United States did not carry a strong legacy of monarchical rule or aristocratic distinctions. There was surplus of land; thanks to the willingness of American citizens to take from the Indians, and a supply of cheap, non-competitive labour, thanks to slavery.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Take Place?</b></i></span> Although the earliest factories were already present in the United States by the end of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the growth of industrialisation during the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century was at first quite slow. The French and British blockades during the Napoleonic wars and the War of 1812 with England cut the United States off from British manufacturers and caused much American commercial capital to be diverted to manufacturing. By the middle decades of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, industrialisation was spreading, particularly in the North-East. However, it was not until the years immediately following the Civil War (1861&ndash;65) that the United States joined other Western nations as a leading industrial power.</p>
<p class="indent">In most ways, industrialisation in the United States proceeded much as it did in other Western countries. New machines and sources of power were applied to the manufacturing process. Large factories sprang up in the East and Midwest, turning raw materials into finished products in great quantities. Working class and urban populations connected with industrialisation grew, fed both by migration from rural areas and massive immigration from Europe. The United States proved subject to the same problems that plagued other industrialising nations: poor working conditions, low pay, child labour; urban slums, inadequate sanitation, and few social services.</p>
<p class="indent">However, there were a few elements that seemed to characterise the United States’ growing industrialisation between 1865 and 1901. Above all, the degree to which business became concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and corporations was striking. Industrial capitalists such as Andrew Carnegie (steel), John D. Rockefeller (oil), Cornelius Vanderbilt (railroads), and J. P. Morgan (finance) amassed unbelievable fortunes and power. The corporations they founded, such as U.S. Steel and Standard Oil, soon gained monopolistic control over vast resources.</p>
<p class="indent">More than in most other nations, in America governmental policies during this period favoured business in general and these huge industrial firms in particular. Not surprisingly, then, in the United States the unionisation of labour was relatively slow to emerge. In part this result was due to the continued abundance of cheap land and the influx of cheap mobile labour from Europe. But unionisation was also deterred by the determined resistance of industrial capitalists backed by private and public police power, and by governmental policies and officials unsympathetic to unionisation. Despite some earlier beginnings in various trades (such as the Knights of Labour), it was not until 1886 that Samuel Gompers, an immigrant from Great England, organised the American Federation of Labour&mdash;the first successful national labour organisation in America.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Role of Railroads?</b></i></span> But industrialisation requires a transportation system that allows efficient movement of raw materials to factories and finished goods to markets. There was no such system in the United States in its early years, and thus there was no domestic market extensive enough to justify large-scale production. But efforts were under way that would ultimately remove the transportation obstacle. In river transportation, a new era <a id="calibre_link-284" class="calibre10"></a>began with the development of the steamboat. Meanwhile, the era that would become known as the turnpike era had begun too; toll roads ran from town to town. Although the railroads played but a secondary role in America’s transportation system in the 1820s and 30s, the work of the railroad pioneers became the basis for the great mid-century surge of railroad building that would link the nation together as never before. Railroads eventually became the nation’s number one transportation system, and remained so until the construction of the interstate highway system halfway during the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="indent">The late 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century belonged to the railroads. They were of crucial importance in stimulating economic expansion, but their influence reached beyond the economy and was pervasive in American society at large. The story of the Iron Horse in 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century America is one with many aspects and paradoxes and deserved a closer look. Which technological developments brought forth the railroads, and how were they managed once they grew beyond small companies? What role did they play in the turbulent times of the Civil War? How did they change the American landscape and its native people? What did the railroads mean to politicians, entrepreneurs, the working class, and immigrants? In short, what was the impact of the railroads on 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century American society?</p>
<p class="indent">Historians argue over the fact whether railroads determined the pace of economic development in 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century America. Robert Fogel, among others, tried to measure the impact of transportation innovations on American development using tools of new economic history, and concluded that the contribution of railroads was not as crucial as some had maintained. The issue is a controversial one, but the fact remains that the railroads came, saw, and conquered 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century America in more ways than one.</p>
<p class="indent">They were liberating&mdash;increasing mobility and speed across the continent&mdash;as well as confining: they held the power of economic life and death over many communities; often abusing that power. The railroads played an important role in developing new concepts of management and brought forth giant corporations, but usually accompanied by obscure financial practices and greed. They provided employment for thousands and thousands of workers, but the conditions under which these labourers had to work and live made them revolt and informed the nation of the hardships of the working class. The railroads were also to a great extent responsible for the settlement of the West, but simultaneously helped extinguish the Native American population. They were a prize to be won for each part of the divided nation in the volatile years before the Civil War, yet linked the nation together with the first transcontinental railroad in 1869. They were born and raised on government money, yet eventually became the first and most heavily regulated segment of the private sector.</p>
<p class="indent">The importance of solving the question whether or not the railroads were the prime stimulus for American economic development fades when focusing on the effect they had on society as a whole. One cannot help but wonder how different America would have looked and functioned had it not been for the railroads.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Impact?</b></i></span> By the end of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the United States not only was a major industrial power but also had outstripped the world in industrial production. The government and the economy of the country were still dominated by big-business interests that controlled the dominant “Old Guard” wing of the Republican Party. Although the United States enjoyed enormous overall economic development, wealth was unequally distributed, causing widespread discontent. Western and Southern farmers had been clamouring for public regulation of the railroads, on which they <a id="calibre_link-285" class="calibre10"></a>were dependent. Small business, labour, and consumers demanded protection against the monopolistic practices and prices of the great trusts and corporations, which were protected by a prohibitively high tariff. The United States government remained behind almost all other industrial nations in its willingness to deal with social abuses stemming from industrialisation. Millions deplored the city slums, the corrupt spoils system in the civil service, and the squandering of natural resources by private interests. The forces of reform were growing and would break out in the two decades following the turn of the century.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Industrialisation in Germany</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Background?</b></i></span> The process of industrialisation in Germany was dominated by the historic divisions of the empire of the German peoples. Before 1815, there were over 300 separate jurisdictional units within the empire, and after 1815 there were still more than 30. These included large advanced states like Prussia, Austria, and Saxony as well as small free cities and the personal enclaves of petty nobles who had guessed right during the Napoleonic wars. Political divisions had more than political impact. Each state clung tenaciously to its local laws and customs, which favored its citizens over outsiders. Merchants who lived near the intersection of separate jurisdictions could find themselves liable for several sets of tolls to move their goods and several sets of custom duties for importing and exporting them. These would have to be paid in different currencies at different rates of exchange according to different regulations of each state. It is no surprise that German merchants exhibited an intense localism, preferring to trade with members of their own state and supporting trade barriers against others. Such obstacles had a depressing effect on the economies of all German states, but pushed with greatest weight against the manufacturing regions of Saxony, Silesia, and the Rhineland.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of imperial Germany was agricultural land suited to a diversity of uses. The mountainous regions of Bavaria and the Austrian alpine communities practiced animal husbandry; there was a grain belt in Prussia, where the soil was poor but the land plentiful, and one in central Germany in which the soil was fertile and the land densely occupied. The Rhine Valley was one of the richest in all of Europe and was the centre of German wine production. The introduction of the potato was the chief innovation of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. While English farmers were turning farms into commercial estates, German peasants were learning how to make do with less land.</p>
<p class="indent">Agricultural estates were organised differently in different parts of Germany. In the East, serfdom still prevailed. Peasants were tied to the land and its lord and were responsible for labour service during much of the week. Methods of cultivation were traditional, and neither peasants nor lords had much incentive to adopt new techniques. The vast agricultural domains of the ‘Prussian Junkers’, as these landlords were called, were built on the backs of cheap serf labour, and the harvest was destined for the Baltic export trade, where world grain prices rather than local production costs would determine profits. In Central Germany, the long process of commuting labour service into rents was nearly completed by the end of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The peasantry was not yet free, as a series of manorial relationships still tied them to the land, but they were no longer mere serfs. Moreover, Western Germany was dominated by free farmers who either owned or leased their lands and who had a purely economic relationship with their landlords. The restriction of peasant mobility in much of Germany posed difficulties for the creation of an industrial workforce. As late as 1800, over 80 per-cent of the German population was engaged in agriculture, a proportion that would drop slowly over the next half century.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-286" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00087.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Spread of Industrialization</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Take Place?</b></i></span> Although Germany was well endowed with natural resources and skilled labour in a number of trades, it had not taken part in the expansion of world trade during the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, and the once bustling Hanseatic ports had been far outdistanced by the rise of the Atlantic economies. The principal exported manufacture was linen, which was expertly spun and woven in Saxony and the Prussian province of Silesia. The linen industry was organised traditionally, with a mixture of domestic production managed on the putting-out system and some factory spinning, especially after the introduction of British mechanical innovations. Even the most advanced factories were still being powered by water, and thus they were located in mountainous regions where rapidly running streams could turn the wheels. In the 1840s, there were only 22 steam-driven spinning mills in Germany, several of them established by the Prussian government, which imported British machines and technicians to run them. Neither linens nor traditional German metal crafts could compete on international markets, but they could find a wider market within Germany if only the problems of political division could be resolved. These were especially acute for Prussia after the reorganisation of European boundaries in 1815.</p>
<p class="indent">Prussian territory now included the coal and iron-rich Rhineland provinces, but a number of smaller states separated these areas from Prussia’s eastern domain. Each small state <a id="calibre_link-287" class="calibre10"></a>exacted its own tolls and customs duties whenever Prussian merchants wanted to move goods from one part of Prussia to the other. Such movement became more common in the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century as German manufacturing began to grow in step with its rising population. Between 1815 and 1865, the population of Germany grew by 60 per-cent to over 36 million people. This was an enormous internal market, nearly as large as the population of France, and the Prussians resolved to make it a unified trading zone by creating a series of alliances with smaller states known as the Zollverein (1834). The Zollverein was not a free-trade zone, as was the British empire, but rather a customs union in which member states adopted the liberal Prussian customs regulations. Every state was paid an annual portion of receipts based upon its population, and every state - except Prussia - increased its revenues as a result. The crucial advantage Prussians received was the ability to move goods and materials from East to West, but Prussia reaped political profits as well. It forced Hanover and Saxony into the Zollverein and kept its powerful rival Austria out. Prussia’s economic union soon proved to be the basis for the union of the German states.</p>
<p class="indent">The creation of the Zollverein was vital to German industrialisation. It permitted the exploitation of natural advantages, like plentiful supplies of coal and iron, and it provided a basis for the building of railroads. Germany was a follower nation in the process of industrialisation. It started late and it self-consciously modelled its success on the British experience. British equipment and engineers were brought to Germany to attempt to plant the seeds of an industrial economy. German manufacturers sent their children to England to learn the latest techniques in industrial management. Friedrich Engels (1820&ndash;95) worked in a Manchester cotton factory, where he observed the appalling conditions of the industrial labour force and wrote, <i class="calibre8">The Condition of the Working Class in England</i> (1845). Steam engines were installed in coal mines, if not in factories, and the process of puddling revolutionised iron-making, though most iron was still smelted with charcoal rather than coke. Although coal was plentiful in Prussia, it was to be found at the Eastern and Western extremities of Germany. Even with the lowering of tolls and duties, it was still too expensive to move over rudimentary roads and an uncompleted system of canals.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus the railroads were the key to tapping the industrial potential of Germany. Here they were a cause rather than a result of industrialisation. The agreements hammered out in the creation of the Zollverein made possible the planning necessary to build single lines across the boundaries of numerous states. Initially German railroads were financed privately, with much foreign investment. Ultimately governments saw the practical advantages of rail transport and took an active part in planning and financing the system. Over a quarter of the track constructed in Prussia before 1870 was owned directly by the government, and most of the rest had been indirectly financed by the government, which purchased land and guaranteed interest on stock issues.</p>
<p class="indent">Germany imported most of its engines directly from England and adopted standard British gauge for its system. As early as 1850, there were over 3500 miles of rail in Germany, with important roads linking the manufacturing districts of Saxony and the coal and iron deposits of the Ruhr. Twenty years later, Germany was second only to England in the amount of track that had been laid and opened. By then it was no longer simply a follower. German engineers and machinists, trained in Europe’s best schools of technology, were turning out engines and rolling stock second to none. The railroads transported a host of highquality manufactures, especially durable metal goods that came to carry the most prestigious <a id="calibre_link-288" class="calibre10"></a>trademark of the late 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century: “Made in Germany.”</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Industrialisation in Japan</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Background?</b></i></span> At a time when Western Imperialism was adversely draining the Asian countries, Japan was not only able to resist large scale foreign penetration, but was also able to lay the foundations for the emergence of a powerful state. The Meiji State (constituted in 1868 after the Meiji Restoration) abolished feudalism, and through other socio-economic and political reforms, sought to thrust Japan in the modern age. At the turn of the century, Japan astonished all powers by its rapid strides of progress.</p>
<p class="indent">Japan’s emergence as a great power became possible, because she chose to westernise herself. The Japanese realised that the superiority of the West lay in their advancement in science and technology and its application. So, the Japanese government encouraged sending promising and brilliant students to Western countries to learn the scientific and technological know-how. Japan also invited foreign industrialists and scientists to set up industries and laboratories on her soil. In course of time, she completely shed its feudal features and accepted the ways of modern civilisation.</p>
<p class="indent">After getting modernised, Japan too, like the other imperialist powers, looked forward to establishing colonies. Her efforts bore fruit in this direction soon after the Sino-Japan War of 1894&ndash;95. She was considered a big power by England during the early years of the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The friendship between Japan and England culminated in a defence treaty&mdash;the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1902. This alliance was directed against a common enemy, Russia. In the Russo Japanese War of 1904&ndash;05, Japan inflicted a crushing defeat upon Russia. The defeat of this European giant at the hands of Japan surprised the whole world. With this victory, Japan emerged as a great power in the world.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was the Industrialisation Done?</b></i></span> After the Meiji Restoration, the Meiji Emperor in an address to his subjects said : ‘At present when the world has greatly progressed and every nation is expanding right and left, only our nation remains remote from the rest of the world, abiding by the old traditions and customs ... Therefore, we pledge ... to ... bring welfare and happiness to our one billion subjects and expand over the unlimited span of ocean and waves to bring forth our national influence, and put our nation on a foundation solid as a rock.’ This address reflected the mood of the leaders of Restoration and indicated the trends that would transform Japan radically within the next few decades.</p>
<p class="indent">The first steps taken by the Meiji leaders were in the field of agriculture. Ban on the sale of land was removed in 1872, and this amounted to recognising the right of private ownership of land. In 1873, the regime put through a new taxlegislation which revised the land tax system from a harvest tax (assessed as a proportion of the harvest in rice or its equivalent in money) to a land value tax (assessed as a proportion of the land value at 3%). In this way, the regime guarded itself against possibility of a fall in revenue as a result of bad harvest. The government was thus assured of a fixed income from agriculture which could be used for developmental purposes.</p>
<p class="indent">The land tax played a crucial role in early capital accumulation. Between 1871 and 1875, it accounted for between 85% and 93% of total government revenue, and dropped to below 50% only after 1896. The state fostered the development of commercial relations in agriculture. The agrarian surplus made the availability of finance for business and industry possible. It accounted also for the flow of labour from the primary to the industrial sector.</p>
<p class="indent">After the Meiji Restoration, rulers decided that Japan must industrialise to be on equal footing with Western intruders. Huge investments were required, but private investment did <a id="calibre_link-289" class="calibre10"></a>not come forward. This made the government adopt a policy of subsidising basic investment in industry.</p>
<p class="indent">In the development of Japanese capitalism, we don’t find clearly the genesis of the capitalist spirit or ethos, and also two other developments, viz. commercial capitalism and industrial organisation on capitalist lines. However, financial capitalism appears. The prime movers in the development of capitalism in Japan were the role of the state and the development of capitalist technology.</p>
<p class="indent">The main features of Japanese capitalist growth, therefore, are vigorous state intervention in the formation, accumulation and investment of capital; concentration in capital goods; state control over banking; state guidance and intervention in foreign trade; low expenditure on consumer goods and virtual absence of many social services.</p>
<p class="indent">The early Japanese capitalism was a hot-house variety growing under the shelter of state protection and subsidy. Big private capital cleverly remained in trade, banking and credit operations, and more so in the safe and lucrative fields of government loans. This point clearly reveals that few people who possessed the capital had the capitalist spirit of making more and more money, irrespective of any reconsideration. The Japanese state wanted to build the nation, but the Japanese capitalists wanted to accumulate wealth. Capital in the rural areas had no inducement to leave the countryside, since trade, usury and above all high rent (nearly 60% of tenant’s crops) prevented rural capital from moving into industrial channels. Industrialisation did not pick up all of a sudden. Ships were built abroad. Till 1914, equipment needed for factories, mines and railways were imported. Till the end of 1870s, foreigners handled more than 9/10<sup class="calibre13">ths</sup> of all trade. But one point indicated that Japan was gradually picking up, i.e., in 30 years (from 1868 to 1897) imports of raw materials for Japanese factories increased five-fold, and in the same period, exports of finished goods rose more than 20-fold.</p>
<p class="indent">Logically from the early stages of Japan’s modern history, the power of the financial oligarchy was increased. The state itself sold its enterprises, except military establishments, to private capitalists at ridiculously low prices. Few families such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo and Yasuda grew in riches. There were more families like these, but these four constituted an important financial oligarchy, called <i class="calibre8">zaibatsu</i>. Such oligarchies developed their own capitalist enterprises. Often these big <i class="calibre8">zaibatsu</i> swallowed small industrial concerns. The policy of keeping military establishments under the state, while pampering the private sector continued till the Allied occupation of Japan in 1945.</p>
<p class="indent">One good outcome that came from the economy being monopolised by <i class="calibre8">zaibatsu</i> concerns was modernisation of technology. The state took its first steps in the form of compulsory education within the country and encouragement to young Japanese to learn from abroad, i.e., acquire skills. Large sectors of the economy were handled by able technicians and experts employed by the combines. This afforded a device by which industrial investment was accelerated ploughing back the huge profits accumulated to the owners.</p>
<p class="indent">The ability of the Japanese to learn about new techniques as well as to develop them has something to do with Japanese character itself. The Japanese cannot think of being second to anyone. This is an important factor to be remembered howsoever mundane it may seem. This innate pride could bear fruit because the Japanese have tremendous ability to adopt the techniques of others to suit their own needs, as for example, the electronics of today.</p>
<p class="indent">While the industrialisation program of the Meiji regime went ahead, the institutional structure needed for capitalism also came into existence. Modern transportation and banking <a id="calibre_link-290" class="calibre10"></a>system were established to support a wide range of heavy industries. In the process, large cartels and monopolies, based in some cases on the <i class="calibre8">zaibatsu</i> came into existence. Thus, within a matter of 50 years after the Meiji Restoration, Japan began to compete with the most industrially advanced countries of the world on equal terms.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was the Society Modernised?</b></i></span> The patriotic <i class="calibre8">diamyos</i> and the <i class="calibre8">samurais</i>, who formed the backbone of the feudal structure, led the Restoration movement, and most of the prominent reforms belonged to these classes. In 1869, the feudal chiefs of the great clans that led the Restoration, proposed the voluntary surrender of the feudal fiefs to the throne. In 1871, an imperial decree ordered the end of feudalism. With the end of feudalism, the old division of the public into four classes was abolished (four classes were <i class="calibre8">samurai</i> or the warrior class, peasantry, artisans and merchants). They were, however, not motivated by patriotism. The real power in the fiefs had already fallen into the hands of the ministers, and so in exchange for a handsome pension, they were willing to give up a shadowy power. Besides, they were mostly included in the expanded bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="indent">The reforms introduced in the field of education were quite revolutionary. Japan’s enthusiasm for the new learning of the West recognised no barriers. Education in feudal Japan had been restricted to men of privileged society; now primary education based on American model was made compulsory in 1882, and by 1883, about 33 lakh pupils were receiving education. From primary schools, the system pyramided upwards through secondary schools to universities. Universities based on French model were established where professors from abroad were induced to accept important positions. Thousands of students were sent to Western countries for receiving higher education.</p>
<p class="indent">Newspapers, first published in 1869, multiplied rapidly, increasing to over a 100 by 1882. Books were translated in large numbers from foreign languages. All these efforts made Japan the most educated country in Asia and technically abreast of the modern mechanical world of science. Compulsory military service and the system of education tended to fuse people into a homogeneous whole, permitted with the same spirit of progress, optimism and patriotism.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to strengthen the enhanced emphasis upon the Emperor, the Shinto cult was revived and patronised. The revival of Shinto was an example that the revolution which followed the Meiji Restoration was in part a return to Japan’s past. The bar on Christianity was also relaxed and the faith made some remarkable advance in the country.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was the Polity Modernised?</b></i></span> After the Restoration, the Emperor moved his residence from Kyoto to Yedo, now renamed Tokyo, which became the new capital. In 1868, the young Emperor read a ‘Charter Oath’ to his officials which contained vague promises of deliberative assemblies, decisions based upon public opinion and the search for wisdom and ability throughout the world. It was Japan’s ‘Declaration of the Rights’ and was a clear sign that a new wind was blowing over the ‘Land of the Rising Sun’.</p>
<p class="indent">The most urgent need after the Restoration was the establishment of a strong government in the centre which would be able to exert its authority over the whole country. A strong centralised government could, however, be established only after the abolition of feudalism. As mentioned earlier, the government itself played an important role in abolishing feudalism. Its abolition greatly helped in the unification of the country and the modernisation of its social pattern and administrative machinery. To divert the long-established narrow local interests into broader national <a id="calibre_link-291" class="calibre10"></a>channels of true patriotism, the Emperor was chosen as the rallying point.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea that the Emperor was the earthly representative of the sun goddess was not only emphasised, but stress was also laid on his being the source of all power and authority; an object of reverence, respect and undying devotion. The focussing of the national sentiment on the throne assisted the cause of unification and internal consolidation. It strengthened the authority of central government. In order to enforce the control of the centre, imperial officials were appointed in every province, and the country was reorganised into prefectures, roughly similar to the American states.</p>
<p class="indent">The bureaucracy was thoroughly reorganised to run the centralised state effectively. With the abolition of feudalism, the <i class="calibre8">samurai</i> class was relieved of its military duty. It now entered in large number in the state administrative machinery, and like the Prussian Junker, nobility became its backbone. Later on, competitive civil service examinations became the method of admission to the service.</p>
<p class="indent">The abolition of feudalism brought about significant changes in the character of Japanese army. It was no longer exclusively recruited from the <i class="calibre8">samurai</i>. The Japanese peasant, who had been denied the right of holding arms for more than 300 years and who had now been gradually freed from many galling restrictions, became the heart of the conscript national army under the reorganised military system. Thus, a national army was now created on the basis of compulsory military training for all. The army was first put under the French and then under German directions. It was modernised and its efficiency was proved in the suppression of the Satsuma rebellion (1877) that signified the last gasp of feudalism. The navy was also reorganised on British model.</p>
<p class="indent">The code of law, both civil and criminal, and the codes of judicial procedure were thoroughly remodelled after an exhaustive study of the western systems. This was stimulated by the desire to be freed from the galling restrictions of extra-territoriality. The Japanese hoped to do away with this humiliating inferiority by introducing the Occidental system of laws.</p>
<p class="indent">Three political parties arose in Japan during this period. These were: (1) Liberals, advocating popular representation; (2) Liberal Conservatives, favouring a gradual extension of franchise; and (3) Constitutional Imperialists who, while in favour of a constitution, were opposed to any action that would weaken the power of the Emperor.</p>
<p class="indent">The ‘Charter Oath’ foreshadowed some sort of parliamentary institution. In 1868, a kind of council of ministers on the existing Chinese model was formed. In 1874, a senate with deliberative powers and composed of representatives of nobility and bureaucracy came into existence. Its aim was to limit the powers of the group that surrounded the Emperor. By 1880, provincial assemblies were established. In the next year, the government promised a national assembly and a constitution latest by 1890.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1889, the constitution which was framed after four years of patient work was promulgated. This ‘Constitution of 1889’ resembled the corresponding document of Bavaria with some changes. The influence of English and American Constitutions can be seen in it. It first defined the powers and position of the Emperor, who was declared to be sacred and inviolable. Like the King of England, he was the fountain of power and his ministers must assume responsibility for his acts. But unlike the English monarch, his succession was outside the jurisdiction of the Diet (Parliament) and he himself was ‘divine’. His executive power was exercised through two constitutional bodies&mdash;Council of Ministers and Privy Council. Both their members were imperial nominees and the Cabinet under constitution was solely responsible to the Emperor. The Imperial Diet <a id="calibre_link-292" class="calibre10"></a>was composed of two houses - the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. Both the houses enjoyed equal powers except that financial legislation had to be introduced in the lower house. The Emperor possessed an absolute veto power over all laws. Besides, the control over the purse was not completely given to the Diet. Finally, the constitution could be amended by the Diet only on imperial order.</p>
<p class="indent">The constitution also laid the foundation of the modern legal system. Unless public peace was threatened, public trials were to be held and all court sessions were to be summoned in the name of the Emperor. The rights and duties of the subjects were defined. Freedom of speech, religion and association were guaranteed. A subject could be arrested only according to the law and must be tried by legally appointed judges. However, the function of passing judgements on the constitutionality of laws and administrative actions was entrusted to the Privy Council and not to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="indent">With the promulgation of this Constitution of 1889, Japan entered the ranks of the constitutional states of the world. With all its drawbacks (such as giving too much power to the aristocratic elements like House of Peers, ‘Genro’ or the body of ‘Elder Statesmen’, Privy Council, etc., bias towards the executive branch in the separation of powers; leaving great scope for conflicts between the two houses of the Diet; denying the Diet complete control over the national purse; absence of Cabinet responsibility to the Diet; etc.), predomination of the constitution marked the beginning of a new stage in Japan’s political life. In spite of the undemocratic and aristocratic bias, it made a real, though modest, advance towards parliamentary government<b class="calibre9">.</b></p>
<p class="indent">Thus, in the second half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, startling changes were made in Japan’s social, economic, political and religious life. A new era had begun which the Micado (Emperor) himself described as the era of ‘Enlightened Rule’ and which affected a sweeping transformation of the country. Within an amazingly short period, Japan adopted the material and scientific civilisation of the West, and made herself in many respects a European state. Thus invigorated, she entered upon an international career which profoundly influenced the history of the Far East in subsequent years. This amazing transformation had intensified rather than weakened the traditional spirit and basic institutions of Japan. The revival of the Shinto cult and the focussing of the Emperor as the rallying point inspired nationalism and patriotism of the people.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did Japan Emerge as a Great Power?</b></i></span> Having modernised herself, Japan now launched herself on the imperialist road. Her recourse to imperialism signified her emergence as a great power. Besides, several factors were responsible for Japan turning into an imperialist country. Growing population, limited land, paucity of raw materials, and a search for market were some of the important factors. Imitating her Western counterparts, Japan looked forward to establishing her own colonies in Asia. The weakness of the Manchu government in China attracted her attention, and she put up her claim to Korea which owed allegiance to China. In the ensuing struggle (1894&ndash;95) for Korea, China was defeated with the result she gave up her claims to Korea. Besides, Japan received from China a huge war indemnity and a few islands on the Chinese coast including Formosa. At the turn of the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, England for her own reasons developed intimacy with Japan which culminated in the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. It was directed against Russia. Meanwhile, Russian ambition in the Far East, particularly Manchuria, posed a threat to Japan’s interests in Korea. Japan tried to settle this dispute with Russia through negotiations but failed. It resulted in a war, viz. the Russo-Japanese War of 1904&ndash;05. The Russians suffered ignominious defeat at Mudken and came to terms. The Treaty of Portsmouth (1905) was signed by which <a id="calibre_link-293" class="calibre10"></a>Russia recognised Japan’s interest over Korea; transferred to her the lease of the Liao-Tung Peninsula, and gave Southern-half of the island of Sakhalin. Russia also agreed to evacuate Manchuria. Japan’s inherent strength at beating a European giant like Russia surprised the whole world. Japan’s success in this war encouraged other Asiatic countries under foreign rule to demand self-government.</p>
<p class="indent">Japan entered the World War I (1914&ndash;18) on the side of England with the hope of adding more territories to her empire from her weak neighbour, China. Taking advantage of the preoccupation of the European powers during the conflict, Japan sent an ultimatum to China in January 1915 to concede to her ‘21 Demands’. Japan also threatened China with a war if these demands were not accepted. Yuan Shi Kai of China privately accepted most of the demands with the hope of retaining his power. Most of these demands were related to territorial claims and economic concessions. America entered into the Lansing-Ishi Agreement with Japan by which she recognised the special claims of Japan over China. At the Paris Peace Conference, China and Japan clashed and put forward conflicting claims. Japan’s claims over China were upheld by the peace conference, and China was very much disappointed. Japan was rewarded with the former German territories in China and a large number of islands. After the First World War, Japan’s prestige <a id="calibre_link-294" class="calibre10"></a>as a world power rose to new heights, and she secured a permanent seat in the League’s Council. Although she looked forward to expanding her empire at the expense of her weak neighbour (China), she was restrained from this course of action by the terms of the Nine Power Treaty to which she was signatory. At the Washington Conference (1921&ndash;22), the nine powers including Japan agreed to respect the Chinese territorial integrity and sovereignty. Therefore, for about a decade, i.e., till the rise of militarism in Japan and the Manchurian crisis (1931), Japan did not trouble China.</p>

<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Socialist Industrialisation in USSR and China</b></h3>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Soviet Socialist Industrialisation</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Nature of its Industrialisation?</b></i></span> The first challenge the Bolsheviks faced after coming to power was that of creating the new socialist society which they had preached for so long. But soon they discovered that it was not an easy task. They had no examples to emulate in history and had to resort to experiments. Initially, there was no scope for experiments because the struggle for survival took precedence over everything else. The so-called ‘War Communism’ that prevailed between 1917 and 1921 evolved out of the desperate measures taken to supply the battle front with essential materials and manpower. Under this War Communism banks, lands, foreign traders and heavy industry were all nationalised. Surplus agricultural produce too was forcibly requisitioned to feed the troops and the city dwellers. The original plan was to compensate the peasants with manufactured goods, but this proved impossible because all that was produced had to be sent to the front.</p>
<p class="indent">With end of the civil war, the necessity for the War Communism ended and it was promptly dropped. Lenin realised that concessions were unavoidable and this led to the adoption of the New Economic Policy, or NEP as it was popularly known, in 1921. It allowed a partial restoration of capitalism. Peasants could sell heir produce on the open market and individuals were allowed to operate small stores and factories. The peasants and new merchants could employ labour and retain any profits made.</p>
<p class="indent">However, Lenin ensured that the state retained control of title to land and banking, foreign trade, heavy industry and transportation. As Lenin saw it, the NEP did not mean the end of socialism but temporary retreat to prepare for a renewed march forward.</p>
<p class="indent">Lenin died in 1924, and his successor, Joseph Stalin, launched in 1928 the first of a series of Five Year Plans. This was an unprecedented move because they provided a blue print and a mechanism for the reorganisation and operation of a nation’s entire economy.</p>
<p class="indent">Stalin once said that the Kulak resistance to collectivisation of land was the most dangerous challenge he encountered. He had no choice but to force his plan on them, for collectivisation was the foundation of the new economy he had blueprinted. The Kulaks opposed collective farms for they had to enter on the same terms as the poor peasants who brought little with them. The Kulaks, in some instances, burnt the buildings of the collectives, poisoned cattle and spread rumours to frighten peasants. The government retaliated by uprooting thousands of Kulak families from villages, putting them in prisons and Siberian labour camps. Eventually, the government had its way so that by 1938, almost all peasant holdings had been combined into 242,400 collective farms or Kolkhozy, and 4,000 state farms or Soukhozy.</p>
<p class="indent">Collectivisation did not prove successful from the viewpoint of production but, nevertheless, it provided the central basis for the Five Year Plans. It eliminated the Kulaks who threatened the existence of the Soviet regime. The peasants too were no longer an independent political force and Soviet authority was firmly <a id="calibre_link-295" class="calibre10"></a>established in the countryside. This, in turn, enabled the Soviet Union to foist much of the losses of industrialisation upon the peasantry. Surplus produce was siphoned off by the state in the form of taxes, and then exported to finance industrialisation.</p>
<p class="indent">While most farms were run as cooperatives, factories were owned and operated by the government. Besides providing industry with the necessary capital, the government also employed a carrot and stick policy to stimulate production. Workers and managers were required to meet certain quotas failing which they faced fines or dismissals. Surpassing quotas, on the other hand, meant bonuses. Trade unions were allowed and recognised, but they were denied the right to strike &ndash; for strikes were incompatible with the goals and functioning of the Soviet economy.</p>
<p class="indent">By the end of the first Five Year Plan in 1952, the Soviet Union rose from the fifth to the second place in industrial output. This spectacular spurt was due not only to the increased productivity but also due to the decline in productivity in the West because of the Great Depression. Nevertheless, Soviet Gross National Product, which included the lagging agricultural as well as the industrial output increased three and a half times during the quarter century between 1928 and 1952 &ndash; a rate of growth surpassing that of any other country during this period.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Lenin’s War Communism?</b></i></span> With the onset of the civil war (between the White Army and the Red Army), the Bolsheviks abandoned the relatively gradual approach that they had taken in economic and social matters since the October Revolution, an approach characterised by Lenin as “one foot in Socialism”. Beginning with the sweeping nationalisation of large scale industry in June, 1918, an attempt was made to transform Russian society directly into the classless communist ideal. At the same time, a pattern of centralisation and coercion was adopted to channel the country’s efforts and resources into victory in the civil war.</p>
<p class="indent">Nationalisation was gradually extended to practically every enterprise of consequence, including small-scale as well as large-scale industry, and trading and service enterprises. Workers’ control was now rejected by Lenin as a hindrance to production; instead, he favoured one-man management by paid experts, with tight centralisation of overall administration of each industry in the Chief Administrators in Moscow. Industrial production, already falling in 1917 as a result of the disruptions of the world war and revolution, continued to sag. Transportation was in a poor state, which contributed further to the stagnation in industry.</p>
<p class="indent">The break-up of large landholdings and inclination of the peasants to consume their produce or curtail production rather than sell it for worthless money caused a catastrophic drop in the food available for the urban sector and the army. The Soviet government responded by having grain ‘requisitioned’ by armed detachments, aided by ‘committees of the village poor’. The result was further disruption of food production and total alienation of the majority of the peasants, to the point of armed insurrection against the soviet authorities in some districts of central Russia.</p>
<p class="indent">Soviet Union experienced its worst internal crisis after the end of the civil war. By the end of 1920, the experiment of war communism, coupled with war-time disruptions, had brought industry almost to a standstill. The countryside was seething with unrest over the requisitioning of food. Strikes, though outlawed by the Soviet government, erupted in the major cities. In March 1921, a serious naval mutiny occurred at Kronstadt, suppressed only through prompt action by Trotsky, who sent troops across the ice on the Bay of Finland.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Lenin’s Nep?</b></i></span> The above naval mutiny seems to have convinced Lenin that a new <a id="calibre_link-296" class="calibre10"></a>approach was needed to win back the wavering support of the peasants. Hence, he introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP). The decisive step marking the end of war communism and the beginning of the era of the NEP was the suspension of food requisitioning and the introduction of a tax in kind specifying the amounts that each peasant had to contribute. From this, there followed a series of measures putting the government on a more legal and orderly basis, while temporarily sacrificed the collectivist and egalitarian goals of the communist party.</p>
<p class="indent">The NEP was explained by Lenin himself as a retreat from the momentarily unattainable goal of communism to state capitalism:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">1.</b></span>Monetary system and the market economy were restored.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">2.</b></span>Peasants were allowed to dispose of their produce freely after meeting their tax obligations.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">3.</b></span>Most trading enterprises and much of small-scale industry were denationalised, permitting the rise of a new class of small businessmen, called the ‘NEP-MEN’.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">4.</b></span>Large-scale industry, transportation, public utilities, the financial system and major natural resources were kept under state ownership.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">5.</b></span>Within state-owned sector also, there were further steps back towards capitalistic economic arrangements. Individual, professional management became the rule, and profit-and-loss account was restored. State-owned enterprises traded with each other and sought to grow by earning profits. Wages and salaries set to reflect effort and responsibility, an acknowledged reversion from the Marxist goal of equality. Economic planning was reduced to a modest effort at forecasting resources, rehabilitating war-torn plants and building up the infrastructure, particularly electric power.</p>
<p class="indent">The NEP quickly achieved a recovery in both agricultural and industrial production. By the mid 1920s, most branches of the economy reached pre-war levels. A major issue then developed over the manner of future development, an issue between the proponents of gradual growth in the pattern of market socialism on the one hand, and the advocates of more deliberate planning for a high tempo of industrialisation on the other. The issue was ultimately decided by the political succession struggle that characterised the Years of the NEP.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How Did Lenin Reconstruct Society?</b></i></span> In literary and cultural matters, the communist regime during this period was generally content to suppress only political opposition allowing a variety of artistic schools to work out their ideas. Strictly speaking, the Soviet regime, while being dictatorial, was not yet totalitarian (it became totalitarian during Stalin’s era); non-political areas were not subjected to the positive and exclusive dictates of official controllers.</p>
<p class="indent">During the period, arts and literature were distinguished by the emergence of a variety of extreme leftist groups, experimenting radically in their respective media and contending for the right to represent the proletariat and the new society.</p>
<p class="indent">In the field of education a doctrine of service to the proletariat was combined with serious attempts at experimentation. At the same time, great strides were made in expanding the basic primary and secondary school system, creating the machinery that substantially wiped out illiteracy among the younger soviet generation. In higher education, class principles required admission preference for children of workers and peasants, regardless of preparation, to the great detriment of the universities. Much was achieved, however, in the education of the working class through the so called ‘rabbak’ (workers’ night courses).</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-297" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Stalin’s Role in Economic Reconstruction?</b></i></span> Industrial expansion was tackled by a series of Five Year Plans, the first two of which (1928&ndash;32 and 1933&ndash;38) were said to have been completed a year ahead of schedule, though in fact neither of them reached the full target. The first plan concentrated on heavy industry&mdash;coal, iron, steel, oil and machinery, which were scheduled to triple output; the two later plans provided for some increases in consumer goods as well as in heavy industry. In spite of mistakes, the plans were a success. By 1940, the USSR has overtaken England in iron and steel production, though not yet in coal, and she was within reach of Germany.</p>
<p class="indent">The cash needed for the industrial expansion was provided almost entirely by the Russians themselves, with no foreign investment; some from grain exports, some from charging peasants heavily for use of government equipment and ruthless ploughing back of profits and surplus. Hundreds of foreign technicians were brought in and great emphasis placed on expanding education in technical colleges and universities and even in factory schools, to provide a whole new generation of skilled workers.</p>
<p class="indent">The problems of agriculture were dealt with by the process known as ‘Collectivisation’. The idea was that the small farms and holdings belonging to the peasants should be merged to form large collective farms jointly owned by the peasants.</p>
<p class="indent">The programme of collectivisation was launched in 1929, and had to be carried out by sheer brute force, so determined was the resistance in the country side. There was no problem in collectivising landless labourers, but all peasants who owned any property at all, whether they were Kulaks or not, were hostile and had to be forced to join by armed bands of party members who urged poorer peasants to seize cattle and machinery from the Kulaks to be handed over to the collectives. Kulaks often responded by slaughtering cattle and burning crops rather than allow the state to take them. Peasants who refused to join collective farms were arrested and deported to labour camps or shot dead. In this manner, well over 90% of all farmland had been collectivised by 1937.</p>
<p class="indent">In one sense, Stalin could claim that collectivisation was a success. For, it allowed greater mechanisation which gradually increased grain output until by 1940, it was over 80% higher than in 1913. On the other hand, so many animals had been slaughtered that it was only in 1953 that livestock production recovered to the 1928 figure, and the cost in human life and suffering was enormous.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did Stalin Reconstruct Society?</b></i></span> The Stalin Era was characterised by the imposition of totalitarian regimentation in practically all realms of life. With his rise, the communist party had been subjected to strict centralisation of authority within its hands. After 1928, using the party as his primary agent of control, Stalin extended this pattern to most aspects of Soviet social, cultural and intellectual life.</p>
<p class="indent">The social pattern of the period was based above all on the subordination of the individual to the collective organisation. This was most apparent, as we have seen above in the elimination of individual economic enterprise among the Kulaks and ordinary peasants, but it also became the rule among writers, scholars and scientists.</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, the old revolutionary impulse towards collective equality was suspended. Stalin put heavy emphasis on the development of individual responsibility, on the strengthening of the authority of organisers and managers, and on the expansion of wage and salary differentials on the basis of skill and effort.</p>
<p class="indent">The educational experimentation of the 1920s was abruptly suspended in 1929. The new emphasis, under the label of ‘poly technicism’, was heavily toward practical industrial skills. In his realm, the challenge of training <a id="calibre_link-298" class="calibre10"></a>uneducated peasants for the tasks and responsibilities of industrial life was a monumental one, but, through a complex network of technical schools and institutions and on-the-job training, the soviet government made a substantial breakthrough in the modernisation of its population.</p>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Chinese Socialist Industrialisation</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Background?</b></i></span> In 1949, when the communists took over, China’s economy was in the doldrums. A period of 37 years of almost continuous warfare, from the time of the fall of the Manchu dynasty in 1912 until 1949, and floods and famines had thrown the Chinese economy out of gear. Between 1927 and 1937, the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai Shek had undertaken a number of progressive measures in education and for the development of the railways and modem industries. All these achievements were wiped out during the SinoJapanese War between 1937 and 1945. The Communists themselves had caused much damage to industries and railways during this period. Dams, irrigation systems and canals were neglected and no repairs were carried out.</p>
<p class="indent">Manchuria, which was the most industrialised part of China, made some progress following the Japanese occupation in 1933, for Japan had put up modem industrial plants in that part of the country. But, in 1945, she withdrew when Russia invaded Manchuria and occupied most of its Northern part. When Russia had to vacate after the War, she dismantled all the industries worth two billion dollars and carried them away to Siberia. Therefore, when the Communists took over, they found that even in Manchuria, the industrial base of China had been shattered. Moreover, runaway inflation had completely demoralised the wage earner and had ruined the economy.</p>
<p class="indent">The Communist government was up against herculean task in putting China back on her industrial feet. She had to begin almost afresh. She had already done some basic work in agriculture in the Soviets, which she had organised in different parts of the country. Through these Soviets and the village councils established by the cadres, land reforms in China had been completed by 1953. Agricultural development was as vital for her as industrial progress. It was essential to increase agricultural output to feed the rapidly increasing population, which had already reached alarming proportions by 1949.</p>
<p class="indent">The Chinese Communist party took up the task of reconstructing the economy in right earnest. China had decided to follow the Russian pattern of socialised industrialisation. The emphasis in the first phase was on the development of heavy industries. The economic growth between 1949 and 1957 passed through two stages: (i) from 1949 to 1953, was the stage of recovery and rehabilitation; (ii) from 1953 to 1957, was the period of the First Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was it done in the First Phase?</b></i></span> In China, there was no capitalist society to precede the Socialist Revolution. The Communist Party of China was fortunate in the sense that the capitalist economy under the Kuomintang government did not become a well-developed economy. If it had been so, it would have discouraged the emergence of a socialist order, as it did in some European countries and Japan. In these countries, rapid industrialisation and economic growth which brought prosperity to the people and gave them a better standard of life removed the main cause of the emergence and spread of Communism, namely, tremendous suffering of the people arising out of their abject poverty and starvation. But the absence of industrial development in China had already led to impoverishment of people; a vast majority of whom lived on the borderline of starvation. Mao made use of their wretched condition to build up the Communist Party <a id="calibre_link-299" class="calibre10"></a>and bring about a Socialist Revolution. At the same time, however, the Communist Party was faced with an uphill task &ndash; it had to build up a backward economy.</p>
<p class="indent">In the cities, the properties including the industries of big capitalists had been confiscated. But the large petty bourgeoisie, comprising lakhs of small shopkeepers, factory owners and traders, was not touched. Instead, it was allowed to expand under government control which was exercised by regulating wages, prices, working conditions, and the supply of raw materials. In spite of this control, however, these petty capitalists had enough freedom to make profits and enjoy a bourgeois lifestyle. This is evident from the fact that between 1949 and 1953, the number of privately-owned industries increased from 123,000 to 150,000 and the number of workers in these industries went up from 1,644,000 to 2,231,000.</p>
<p class="indent">It is obvious from these facts that the communist government encouraged this kind of capitalism for the time being as a matter of expediency. A total nationalisation of industries in 1949 would have led to a breakdown of the economy. In order to reconstruct the war-torn economy of the country and to acquire a good economic basis to build upon, the communists needed the managerial skills and technical expertise which the bourgeoisie alone could supply. When this foundation had been laid, they ruthlessly wiped out all forms of capitalism. By 1956, state ownership of business and industry was complete. This is evident from the fact that private enterprise was allowed only in such inconsequential economic activities as those of peddlers, very small shopkeepers and selfemployed handicraftsmen.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was it Done in the Second Phase?</b></i></span> In order to build a strong socialist economy, Mao followed the Russian model of economic development. It was Lenin who had laid a special stress on the development of heavy industries with the help of a centralised political authority. Lenin’s premise that rapid economic development would be possible by nationalising the means of production and that this “would more or less automatically guarantee the arrival of a socialist society” was unhesitatingly accepted by Mao for two reasons. In the first place, China was dependent on Russia for technical know-how, machinery and personnel. No other country was prepared to offer economic aid to her on a scale which Russia gave. Secondly, Russian economic development had faced the very problems which confronted China - the problems arising out of her economic, industrial and technical backwardness. It was in recognition of these problems that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid was signed in 1950 following Mao’s first visit to Russia. In terms of this treaty, the Soviet Union agreed to set up 50 model industrial units in China and supply the necessary technical personnel to man them.</p>
<p class="indent">The Chinese adoption of the Russian model of economic development helped to strengthen the friendship between the two countries, for both were socialist and both were looked upon with apprehension by Western capitalist nations. It was in these circumstances that the First Five Year Plan (1953&ndash;57) was launched for the economic development of China.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b class="calibre9">First Five Year Plan:</b> A Planning Commission was set up in 1952, which fixed Plan targets and quotas, and the method of achieving them. While 88.8 per cent of the state’s capital investment in industry was earmarked for heavy industry, only 11.2 per cent was allotted to the production of consumer goods. This was done in the belief that a heavy industrial base would assist in the development of consumer goods industries and in the technological modernisation of agriculture. Despite many difficulties, China made astonishing progress during the first decade of the Republic in almost every field &ndash; industry, agriculture, communications, construction, education and public health. Her <a id="calibre_link-300" class="calibre10"></a>problems in regard to industrial development were similar to those of any economically underdeveloped country.</p>
<p class="noindent">These problems were:</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(a)</b></span>Lack of financial resources</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(b)</b></span>Lack of technical know-how</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(c)</b></span>Shortage of natural resources</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(d)</b></span>Absence of hard work</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(e)</b></span>Corruption at all levels of the administration</p>
<p class="indent">The Chinese Government overcame all the difficulties. Mao Zedong ruthlessly created the right atmosphere by introducing strict control, internal peace, law and order and unity of purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Russian Help:</b></i></span> Russia came forward with aid on a massive scale and met almost every Chinese need in the initial stages of her growth. Moreover, there was tremendous enthusiasm among the people, who are ready for self-sacrifice and who were willing to work hard intelligently and with resourcefulness. They learnt the new techniques and methods of modern industry. Here, again, Russian help proved to be one of vital importance. For Russian technical and financial assistance, China, despite her intelligent and hardworking people, would have taken much longer to achieve what she did in the first 10 years. Russia not only gave financial assistance and technical know-how; she also sent the machinery and industrial plants to China because she believed that China would be under her political tutelage and that, with her help, she would be able to build a vast bulwark of communist opposition to the capitalist bloc. In 1957, however, Khrushchev realised that Mao was not the man to toe the Russian line blindly.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Rapid Progress:</b></i></span> Russia’s relations with China became somewhat strained. In 1960, she decided to withdraw all her aid and technical assistance. But, by that time, Chinese scientists and technicians had gained sufficient knowledge to be able to work on their own. China became technologically one of the advanced countries of the world, having exploded her first atomic bomb. She made her first guided missile with a nuclear warhead in 1956; exploded a hydrogen bomb in 1967, and launched an earth satellite in 1970. With her ICBMs, 2,500 military aircrafts, 10 million soldiers and a large naval force, she has emerged as one of the strongest nations, next only to the USA and the USSR.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Condition of Industries in 1950:</b></i></span> In 1949, the modern industrial sector in China was small and mostly foreign-owned. Most of the industries, generally light industries, were situated on the Eastern coast and in Manchuria. Her steel production was not more than one million tons. There were hardly any machine manufacturing industries. Electric power stations were few, and production of electricity was limited. There were only, 12,000 miles of railways, which connected some of the important cities. Her industrial base and infrastructure were smaller than those of India in 1947.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Inflation Controlled:</b></i></span> Before it did anything else, the government had to control inflation which was so terrible that a single meal cost a million dollars. Currency notes had become worthless paper. In 1950, the People’s Bank was asked to take over the control of all paper money, limit its supply and restore its value. The other measures adopted to curb inflation were: (i) The government paid low wages to all its servants; (ii) Other employers provided the workers with daily necessities and gave them a few notes to purchase luxuries. At the same time, the prices of all necessities of life were controlled. These measures helped to reduce the amount of money in circulation. The value of the currency was stabilised.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">State Control of Industries:</b></i></span> The Communists took over control of banking, trade, railways, steel and other key industries. The assets of the ‘Four Great Families’ were also taken over. The property and assets of American firms <a id="calibre_link-301" class="calibre10"></a>were confiscated soon after the outbreak of the Korean War. Many foreign firms, which were involved in Communist-dominated labour disputes, sold their industries to the government. Those who were neither capitalists nor reactionaries were allowed to continue, so that their technical and managerial skills might be available to the Chinese, and the pace of production might be maintained. During the Korean War, the government launched five ‘anti-campaigns’ against bribery, corruption, tax evasion, fraud and theft of state property. Charges were brought against industries, which were heavily fined. Some of the owners of large plants had to sell their assets to the government. The remaining were compelled to take the government as a partner. In 1953, the government told them that it would gradually absorb all private enterprises. By September 1956, it reported that 98.7 per cent of industrial production in the country was controlled by the state. Whenever it took over an industry, it asked the managerial staff to continue until the communists were trained to take over.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Significance of Russian Aid:</b></i></span> It may be pointed out here that China planned her whole industrial development around 156 large key industrial plants which Russia had helped her to set up. But Soviet loan covered only 31 per cent of the cost of equipment and supplies for these 156 industries. During the First Five Year Plan, Russian aid constituted only three per cent while the remaining 97 per cent came from China itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Russian knowledge of technology and experience in centralised economic planning, which was made available to the Chinese in abundance, proved to be more important than Russian financial help. Russians provided equipment for the installation of 156 industrial plants as well as the personnel to man them. They trained the Chinese for these jobs. What was even more significant was the fact that Russia supplied blueprint and technological information for a great variety of construction projects and industries. In the 1950s, nearly 6,000 Chinese students were educated in Russian universities in science and technology, while about 7,000 industrial workers went to Russia to receive training in a variety of skills. Moreover, about 12,000 Russian engineers and technicians were sent to China to set up and organise the various industries.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Impact?</b></i></span> The development of the steel industry received top priority. In 1949, China produced only 158,000 tons. The Japanese steel mills in Anshan in Manchuria, which produced 800,000 tons, had been dismantled by the Russians. By 1951, the steel industries in Anshan had been restored. At Anhui, Wuhan and Shanghai, major steel mills were built with the help of Russia. Between 1951 and 1957, steel production increased six times. In 1957, China produced 5,350,000 tons. By 1960, she had made considerable progress and had built several large furnaces, which included the modern Paotu plant. There were 73 small and big steel plants by 1960, which produced 18,500,000 tons of steel. This was five times more than India produced at that time. In 1959, she surpassed even the U.K. in the production of coal. In 1960, she produced 425 million tons of coal. Her coal, however, was of inferior quality.</p>
<p class="indent">China made good use of this tremendous increase in the production of steel and coal to build up metal-cutting machine tools, the production of which increased from 50,000 in 1958 to 90,000 in 1960. In two years, she had almost doubled her production. This helped her to manufacture her own trucks, cars, tractors, jet planes, etc., though not in sufficient quantities. Electrical goods, rolling stock and nearly eight per cent of the equipment needed for the manufacturing industry were also produced. The number of tractors increased from 2,719 in 1953 to 24,629 in 1957, which shot up to 110,000 in 1962. The production of cement increased from 141,000 tons in 1950 to 1,227,000 tons in <a id="calibre_link-302" class="calibre10"></a>1959 and was estimated to have gone up to 16 million tons in 1960. China’s locomotive industry, which was based in Dairen, produced 20 locomotives in 1952. By 1960, it reportedly produced 800 locomotives and 32,000 goods wagons. Her cotton mills increased their production from 2,790 million metres of cloth to 7,500 million metres in 1959. The production of electric power went up from 9,200 million kilowatt hours to 55,000 million kilo-watt hours in 1960.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of these statistics have been published by China, but there has been no way of verifying the accuracy of these figures. Various sinologists have tried to come to their own conclusions regarding the rate of the growth of industrial production by different methods of analysis. Most of them are of the view that the figures published by China are exaggerated. Even if we discount Chinese claims by as much as 30 per cent, the achievements are still fantastic. It may be pointed out here that there was a fall in the production of most of these articles between 1960 and 1964. For example, steel production went down from 18.5 million tons to 7 or 8 million tons; coal production dropped from 425 to l90 million tons; cement from 16 million to 6million tons; and the production of trucks decreased from 29,000 to 3,000. The reasons for this decline in production were the withdrawal of Russian help and unprecedented floods and droughts between 1959 and 1961. However, the production of all these items picked up again after 1964.</p>
<p class="indent">Chinese claims of industrial production at the end of the First Five-Year Plan were equally fantastic. Plan targets had been over-fulfilled. Industrial production more than doubled. The annual growth rate of industries reached 18 per cent, while the Plan target was only 14 per cent. The production of capital goods had increased by 204 per cent, with an average annual growth rate of about 25 per cent. During the First Plan period, the production of consumer goods had increased by 85 per cent; that of steel had gone up by 296.6 per cent; sugar production had increased by 247 per cent. The production of cotton yarn had increased only by 28.5 per cent because of the failure of agriculture.</p>
<p class="indent">With the development of industries in China, the number of industrial workers increased from 6 million to 10 million during the Plan period. Simultaneously, the number of cities increased, raising the urban population from 70 million to 100 million people.</p>
<p class="indent">All this industrial progress was achieved because the Chinese workers worked for longer hours without demanding higher wages. Their leaders told them that unless they were prepared to suffer hardships, the country would have no great future. Zhou Enlai told them to bear certain hardships and inconvenience in order that in the long run, “we shall live in prosperity and happiness.” He urged them not to seek petty benefits now and “never be able to shake off poverty and back-wardness.”</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-35"><b class="calibre9">INDUSTRIALISATION AND GLOBALISATION</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Meaning?</b></i></span> Globalisation is one of the most charged issues of the day. It is everywhere in public discourse&mdash;in TV sound bites and slogans on placards, on websites and learned journals, in parliaments, corporate boardrooms and labour meeting halls. Extreme opponents charge it with impoverishing the world’s poor, enriching the rich and devastating the environment, while fervent supporters see it as a high-speed elevator to universal peace and prosperity.</p>
<p class="indent">Amazingly for so widely used a term, there does not appear to be any precise, widely-agreed definition. Indeed the breadth of meanings attached to it seems to be increasing rather than narrowing over time, taking on cultural, political and other connotations in addition to the economic. However, the most common <a id="calibre_link-303" class="calibre10"></a>or core sense of economic globalisation surely refers to the observation that in recent years a quickly rising share of economic activity in the world seems to be taking place between people who live in different countries (rather than in the same country). This growth in cross-border economic activities takes various forms.</p>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is its Nature and Course?</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">International Trade:</b></i> A growing share of spending on goods and services is devoted to imports from other countries. A growing share of what countries produce is sold to foreigners as exports. Among rich or developed countries, the share of international trade in total output (exports plus imports of goods relative to GDP) rose from 27 to 39 per cent between 1987 and 1997. For developing countries it rose from 10 to 17 per cent.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):</b></i> Firms based in one country increasingly make investments to establish and run business operations in other countries. US firms invested US$133 billion abroad in 1998, while foreign firms invested US$193 billion in the US. Overall world FDI flows more than tripled between 1988 and 1998, from US$192 billion to US$610 billion, and the share of FDI to GDP is generally rising in both developed and developing countries. Developing countries received about a quarter of world FDI inflows in 1988&ndash;98 on average, though the share fluctuated quite a bit from year to year. This is now the largest form of private capital inflow to developing countries.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Capital Market Flows:</b></i> In many countries (especially in the developed world) savers increasingly diversify their portfolios to include foreign financial assets (foreign bonds, equities, loans), while borrowers increasingly turn to foreign sources of funds, along with domestic ones. While flows of this kind to developing countries also rose sharply in the 1990s, they have been much more volatile than either trade or FDI flows, and have also been restricted to a narrower range of ‘emerging market’ countries.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is its Impact and Significance?</b></i></span> First, it is crucial in discussing globalisation to carefully distinguish between its different forms. International trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and capital market flows raise distinct issues and have distinct consequences: potential benefits on the one hand, and costs or risks on the other, calling for different assessments and policy responses. The World Bank generally favours greater openness to trade and FDI because the evidence suggests that the payoffs for economic development and poverty reduction tend to be large relative to potential costs or risks (while also paying attention to specific policies to mitigate or alleviate these costs and risks).</p>
<p class="indent">It is more cautious about liberalisation of other financial or capital market flows, whose high volatility can sometimes foster boom-and-bust cycles and financial crises with large economic costs, as in the emerging-market crises in East Asia and elsewhere in 1997&ndash;98. Here the emphasis needs to be more on building up supportive domestic institutions and policies that reduce the risks of financial crisis before undertaking an orderly and carefully sequenced capital account opening.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, the extent to which different countries participate in globalisation is also far from uniform. For many of the poorest leastdeveloped countries the problem is not that they are being impoverished by globalisation, but that they are in danger of being largely excluded from it. The miniscule 0.4 per cent share of these countries in world trade in 1997 was down by half from 1980. Their access to foreign private investment remains negligible. Far from condemning these countries to continued isolation and poverty, the urgent task of the international community is to help them become better integrated in the world economy, providing assistance to help them <a id="calibre_link-304" class="calibre10"></a>build up needed supporting institutions and policies, as well as by continuing to enhance their access to world markets.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, it is important to recognise that economic globalisation is not a wholly new trend. Indeed, at a basic level, it has been an aspect of the human story from earliest times, as widely scattered populations gradually became involved in more extensive and complicated economic relations. In the modern era, globalisation saw an earlier flowering towards the end of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, mainly among the countries that are today developed or rich. For many of these countries trade and capital market flows relative to GDP were close to or higher than in recent years. That earlier peak of globalisation was reversed in the first half of the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, a time of growing protectionism, in a context of bitter national and great-power strife, world wars, revolutions, rising authoritarian ideologies, and massive economic and political instability.</p>
<p class="indent">In the last 50 years, the tide has flown towards greater globalisation once more. International relations have been more tranquil (at least compared to the previous half century), supported by the creation and consolidation of the United Nations system as a means of peacefully resolving political differences between states, and of institutions like the GATT (today the WTO), which provide a framework of rules for countries to manage their commercial policies. The end of colonialism brought scores of independent new actors onto the world scene, while also removing a shameful stain associated with the earlier 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century episode of globalisation. The 1994 Uruguay Round of the GATT saw developing countries become engaged on a wide range of multilateral international trade issues for the first time.</p>
<p class="indent">The pace of international economic integration accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s, as governments everywhere reduced policy barriers that hampered international trade and investment. Opening to the outside world has been part of a more general shift towards greater reliance on markets and private enterprise, especially as many developing and communist countries came to see that high levels of government planning and intervention were failing to deliver the desired development outcomes.</p>
<p class="indent">China’s sweeping economic reforms since the end of the 1970s, the peaceful dissolution of communism in the Soviet bloc at the end of the 1980s, and the taking root and steady growth of market based reforms in democratic India in the 1990s are among the most striking examples of this trend. Globalisation has also been fostered by technological progress, which is reducing the costs of transportation and communications between countries. Dramatic falls in the cost of telecommunications, of processing, storing and transmitting information, make it much easier to track down and close on business opportunities around the world, to coordinate operations in far-flung locations, or to trade online services that previously were not internationally tradable at all.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, given this backdrop, it may not be surprising (though it is not very helpful) that ‘globalisation’ is sometimes used in a much broader economic sense, as another name for capitalism or the market economy. When used in this sense, the concerns expressed are really about key features of the market economy, such as production by privately-owned and profitmotivated corporations, frequent reshuffling of resources according to changes in supply and demand, and unpredictable and rapid technological change. It is certainly important to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the market economy as such, and to better understand the institutions and policies needed to make it work most effectively. Societies need to think hard about how to best manage the implications of rapid technological change. There is little to be gained by confusing these distinct <a id="calibre_link-305" class="calibre10"></a>(though related) issues with economic globalisation in its core sense, that is the expansion of cross-border economic ties.</p>
<p class="indent">The best way to deal with the changes being brought about by the international integration of markets for goods, services and capital is to be open and honest about them. Globalisation brings opportunities, but it also brings risks. While exploiting the opportunities for higher economic growth and better living standards that openness brings, policymakers&mdash;international, national and local&mdash;also face the challenge of mitigating the risks for the poor, vulnerable and marginalised, and of increasing equity and inclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Even when poverty is falling overall, there can be regional or sectoral increases about which society needs to be concerned. Over the last century, the forces of globalisation have been among those that have contributed to a huge improvement in human welfare, including raising countless millions out of poverty. Going forward, these forces have the potential to continue bringing great benefits to the poor, but how strongly they do so will also continue to depend crucially on factors such as the quality of overall macroeconomic policies, the workings of institutions, both formal and informal, the existing structure of assets, and the available resources, among many others. In order to arrive at fair and workable approaches to these very real human needs, government must listen to the voices of all its citizens.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Globalisation and Liberalisation&mdash;Merits and Demerits</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What do they Mean?</b></i></span> The controversial catchwords of globalisation and liberalisation are interchangeable and appear to be the twin sides of the same coin, but the former has an international connotation while the latter has an essentially domestic context. Globalisation increases interdependence and economic integration among various countries through the enlarged flow of commodities, capital, finance and information across the globe. It removes barriers in the way of greater interdependence and global economic integration. Liberalisation involves dismantling of government control and regulations within the countries along with the privatisation of the public sector and public utilities. Government policies are restructured to ensure free competition.</p>
<p class="indent">Since World War II international trade has been greatly facilitated by agreements among trading countries on a set of rules for international trade, known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). These rules were developed through a series of international trade negotiations, through which export subsidies were banned on everything but agricultural products and tariffs on manufactured goods were reduced to inconsequential levels. The full-blown process became fully operative after the implementation of the GATT treaty of 1994 with the establishment of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1995.</p>
<p class="indent">Globalisation is not only economic, but political, technological and cultural as well. Globalisation, in fact, is a complex set of processes, rather than a single one. They operate, not in a harmonious, but contradictory fashion.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What are the Merits?</b></i></span> Globalisation and Liberalisation bring in a greater role for market forces than state planning and regularisation. They lead to greater fiscal discipline and reduction in subsidies for production, removal of protectionism and expansion in the production base. Even in agriculture, the scope of subsidies described as the Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) is limited to 10 per cent of the value of the produce in developing countries and 5 per cent in the case of advanced nations.</p>
<p class="indent">Global market and international competition promote efficiency in production by weeding out the inefficient. The international competition and the inflow of new technology are considered engines of economic growth, modernisation and global integration. They <a id="calibre_link-306" class="calibre10"></a>enable us to obtain the best goods and services that some other country can produce at relatively lower cost than we can. In every country, each household’s real purchasing power rises. Thus, their incomes stretch further because they can obtain at lower cost the goods and services they have been buying.</p>
<p class="indent">They benefit the country as a whole, too. When a country opens its borders to free movement of goods and services, the market provides incentives to move the country’s resources&mdash;land, labour, and capital&mdash;into their highest value uses, thereby facilitating economic growth. Structural adjustments are needed to reap the potential benefits from globalisation, i.e., increases in both consumer purchasing power and potential GDP. The market must, therefore, be allowed to reallocate resources from the sectors that have lost competitiveness to sectors that can compete.</p>
<p class="indent">They create an environment in which export-led economic growth reduces poverty by hiking up wages in low income countries. As poor people’s incomes rise, they gain purchasing power and become better markets for the products that others produce more efficiently. This has happened frequently, particularly in Asian countries like Taiwan, Korea, South East Asian countries, and is happening now in China and India.</p>
<p class="indent">The countries facing a balance of payment crisis are given loans by the IMF under the structural adjustment program (SAP) with the conditionality of restructuring their economies. The World Bank also provides the necessary support and ideas for this kind of policy shift. The Latin American countries were the first to accept the SAP of the Fund-Bank duo in the 1970s when they could not absorb the shock of the oil price hike. They were followed by Asian and African countries in the 1980s and early 1990s, and the East European and Central Asian republics of the erstwhile Soviet Union in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="indent">When Globalisation and Liberalisation occur, the gains of the gainers exceed the losses of the losers. In the process, the country as a whole benefits. Since the gains of the gainers exceed the losses of the losers, it should be possible to compensate the losers for their losses and still end up with a net gain to society as a whole.</p>
<p class="indent">They have made instantaneous communication possible from one side of the world to the other for the first time ever. Other types of electronic communication, more and more integrated with satellite transmission, have also accelerated over the past few years. Instantaneous electronic communication is not just a way in which news or information is conveyed more quickly. Its existence alters the very texture of our lives, rich and poor alike. The reach of media technologies is growing with each wave of innovation. It took half-a-century for radio in India to gain an audience of 50 million, but Internet needed much lesser time to reach 50 million Indians.</p>
<p class="indent">They have been influencing intimate and personal aspects of our lives. There has never before been a society, so far as we know from the historical record, in which women have been even approximately equal to men. This is a truly global revolution in everyday life, whose consequences are being felt around the world in spheres from work to politics. The debate about family values is very much part of the globalising influences. Traditional family systems are becoming transformed, or are under strain, in many parts of the world, particularly as women stake claim to greater equality.</p>
<p class="indent">The collapse of Soviet communism has added further weight to such globalising developments, since no significant group of countries any longer stands outside. That collapse was not just something that defies explanation. Globalisation explains both why and how Soviet communism met its end. The Soviet Union and the East European countries were comparable to the West in terms of growth <a id="calibre_link-307" class="calibre10"></a>rates until the early 1970s. After that point, they fell rapidly behind. Soviet communism, with its emphasis upon state-run enterprise and heavy industry, could not compete in the global electronic economy. The ideological and cultural control upon which communist political authority was based similarly could not survive in an era of global media. The Soviet and the East European regimes were unable to prevent the reception of western radio and TV broadcasts. Television played a direct role in the 1989 revolutions, which have rightly been called the first ‘television revolutions’.</p>
<p class="indent">Globalisation is becoming increasingly decentered, i.e., it is not under the control of any one or group of nations, and still less of the large corporations. Its effects are felt just as much in the western countries as elsewhere. This is true of the global financial system, communications and media, and of changes affecting the nature of government itself. Examples of ‘reverse colonisation’ are becoming more and more common. Reverse colonisation means that non-western countries influence developments in the west. The best examples are the Latinising of Los Angeles, the emergence of a globallyoriented high-tech sector in India, or the selling of Brazilian TV programs to Portugal.</p>
<p class="indent">Presently, globalisation and liberalisation are no more perceived as choice, but as necessity, for a vast majority of the countries. Realising their necessity and acknowledging their inevitability, all governments are trying their best to make the process as smooth and advantageous as possible.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What are the Demerits?</b></i></span> Globalisation and liberalisation are by no means wholly benign in their consequences. To many non-western nations, they appear to be Westernisation or even Americanisation, since the US is now the sole superpower, with a dominant economic, cultural and military position in the global order. Many of the most visible cultural expressions of globalisation are all American&mdash;Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, etc. Most of giant multinational companies (MNCs) are based in the US too. Those that aren’t all come from the rich countries, of the world. This non-western view of globalisation would consider it largely an affair of the industrial North, in which the developing societies of the South play little or no active part.</p>
<p class="indent">They are seen as destroying national cultures, widening world inequalities and worsening the lot of the impoverished. Globalisation creates a world of winners and losers, a few on the fast track to prosperity, and the majority condemned to a life of misery and despair. Indeed the statistics are daunting. The share of the poorest fifth of the world’s population in global income has dropped from 2.3% to 1.4% over the past 10 years. The proportion taken by the richest fifth, on the other hand, has risen from 70% to 85%. In sub-Saharan Africa, 20 countries have lower incomes per head in real terms than they did two decades ago.</p>
<p class="indent">The agents of globalisation, the MNCs, represent monopoly capital and structurally would not allow percolation of the gains of productivity rise for the host countries and their poor people. These corporations use more controls over their production, technologies and location of operations through their networks than the centrally planned economies. Thus globalisation in the present phase is largely for unrestricted operations of MNCs, with unrestricted propagation of Western culture and ideas. It is not for the global movement of labour and free flow of knowledge and technology across the countries.</p>
<p class="indent">In many less developed countries, safety and environmental regulations are low or virtually non-existent. Some trans-national companies sell goods there that are controlled or banned in the industrial countries &ndash; poor quality medical drugs, destructive pesticides or high tar and nicotine content cigarettes. What is happening is not the growth of a global village, rather it is more like global pillage.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-308" class="calibre10"></a>The security environment is deeply affected by the current process of globalisation and liberalisation. Once economic security and stability of a country are undermined, nothing can save its unity and integrity. One of the serious consequences is a greater threat to a country’s economic stability is borne out by the bitter experience of different Latin American countries, such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico. They were the first to accept the SAP of the IMF and borrowed petro-dollars from US commercial banks at commercial rates in the decade of the 1970s. They opened up and gave export orientation to their economies and were involved in a debt trap in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="indent">Opening up a country, or regions within it, to free trade can undermine a local subsistence economy. An area that becomes dependent upon a few products sold on world markets is very vulnerable to shifts in prices as well as to technological change. In the 1990s, East Asian countries suffered a major blow of destabilisation after they opted for opening up and greater integration with the global economy.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to the claims, globalisation has retained barriers, rather made stricter, for the movement of people, particularly from the developing to the advanced countries. A company, generally MNC, making investment abroad can deploy its manpower in the host country without facing any discrimination vis-a*-vis the local population. The migration of population would continue to be regulated by the emigration laws of the nations (advanced) concerned, which, faced with growing domestic unemployment, have made the migration from the developing countries quite tight and difficult.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, the flow of technology to the developing countries has also been made tighter. With the trade-related intellectual property rights TRIPS under the WTO, uniform global patent laws are coming into force. The patents have been extended to new plant varieties also. The use of new (patented) technology by noninventors necessitates the payment of royalty to the patent holders. This has allowed monopolisation of the use of new technology largely to MNCs in advanced countries, and restricted its flow to developing countries and to the non-inventors (largely non-MNC users).</p>
<p class="indent">The structural adjustments demanded by the globalising agencies are neither costless nor painless. They hurt people who have specialised skills that are salable only in the sectors that are in decline. They also hurt people who have made investments in specialised machinery and factories that are not useful in producing other things than those they were designed to produce. Firms that lose their competitiveness are likely to become bankrupt. Investors in the business suffer capital losses. In the agricultural sector, a loss in competitiveness means not a mere financial loss but social disgrace and eventual suicide.</p>
<p class="indent">When an industry becomes sick and closes, it is traumatic to the local community and to the individual employees. Change of work can be costly in both monetary and emotional terms. Changing one’s line of work often requires reorientation and retraining, which may involve significant expenditure. Changing jobs may require a physical relocation, and involves the emotional cost of leaving family and friends behind and starting over in a new community.</p>
<p class="indent">Globalisation and liberalisation are indifferent to national borders. Nations have lost most of the sovereignty they once had, and national leaders have lost most of their capability to influence events. The era of the nation state is being threatened, and nations are sought to be transformed to mere ‘fictions’.</p>
<p class="indent">They are dismantling the welfare systems and cutting back on state expenditures. What is happening is almost a reversion to how the world was a century ago, with unrestricted and unregulated capitalist exploitation. They <a id="calibre_link-309" class="calibre10"></a>are neither employment-friendly nor do they care much for the poor. Employment generation and poverty removal are no more seen as state responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is their Significance?</b></i></span> How far a given economy should be exposed to the world marketplace must depend upon a range of criteria. Yet to oppose globalisation and liberalisation, and to opt for economic protectionism, would be a misplaced tactic for rich and poor nations alike. Protectionism may be a necessary strategy at some times and in some countries. More permanent forms of protection will not help the development of the poor countries, and among the rich would lead to warring trade blocs. It is pertinent on the part of the governments of the developing countries like India to be vigilant and careful while making decisions on the direction and doses of globalisation and liberalisation to be administered.</p>
<p class="indent">Issues like economic stability, growth, employment generation, poverty removal and food security cannot be left to the market forces and global economy. This can be done at the country’s peril. Of course, globalisation and liberalisation have brought opportunities but with several risks and various kinds of insecurity for the economy. The opportunities have to be utilised, and the risks and insecurity to be avoided through appropriate policy measures.</p>
<p class="indent">With regard to their implications for the nation-state, one can say that nation-states are still relevant and political leaders have a large role to play in the contemporary world. Yet at the same time the nation-state is being reshaped before our eyes. National economic policy cannot be as effective as it once was. More importantly, nations have to rethink their identities now the older forms of geopolitics are becoming obsolete. Nations today face risks and dangers rather than enemies.</p>
<p class="indent">Globalisation and liberalisation are creating something that has never existed before, a global cosmopolitan society. We are the first generation to live in this society, whose contours we can as yet only dimly see. It is shaking up our existing ways of life, no matter where we happen to be. The powerlessness we experience is not a sign of personal failings, but reflects the incapacities of our institutions. We need to reconstruct those we have, or create new ones, in ways appropriate to the global age. We should come to grips with our rapidly transforming world. For globalisation is the way we now live.</p>

<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">By 1850, many of the liberal and nationalistic aspirations of revolutionaries were dashed as conservative, authoritarian rulers came to power. However, nationalism as a dynamic force remained powerful and continued to increase in strength during the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries. Between 1850 and 1871 almost all political leaders, whether liberal or conservative, recognised the strength of nationalism. Nationalism’s political impact was manifested most dramatically in the successful struggles for national unification in Italy and Germany. Broadly, nationalism played a crucial role in the growing authority of the nation-state. Increasingly, central governments had to justify and bolster their authority by reference to a nation of citizens rather than dynastic links to the past. The period from 1850 to 1871, marks the beginning of a time when nationalism grew from earlier roots to become a dominant force in Western political life, and when the nation-state took on new authority and new functions.</p>
<p class="indent">Nationalism may be defined as feelings of common cultural identity and loyalty to one’s country. What are the essential factors that contribute to these feelings? What makes a person a German or a Pole, even when there is no German or Polish national state?</p>
<p class="indent">The most important factor is language. Language brings people together in understanding and separates them from those they cannot understand. Probably second in importance is a historical tradition of unity. The Belgians with their two languages and the Swiss with their three languages and two religions illustrate the importance of this factor. Religion can be a powerful factor, too, though not as important as language. The German Empire with its common language came and held together in spite of a serious religious cleavage, and the Austrian Empire fell apart along language lines in spite of a common <a id="calibre_link-313" class="calibre10"></a>religion and a long tradition of unity under the Hapsburgs. Territorial compactness and natural boundaries frequently contribute to nationalism.</p>
<p class="indent">Until the French Revolution, national loyalty was chiefly cantered on the ruling monarch or dynasty and was limited for the most part to the educated upper classes who participated in the government of the nation. The French Revolution gave birth to a new and more virile kind of nationalism. The establishment of equal rights and popular representative government, together with the abolition of old provincial boundary lines, brought the masses of people into direct partnership with the national government. Universal conscription into the revolutionary armies gave people a sense of fraternity in a righteous cause&mdash;a crusade. Nationalism acquired attributes of a religion. Such mass dynamism helped make the revolutionary and Napoleonic armies irresistible.</p>
<p class="indent">Nationalism soon spread to other places of Europe. In the decades following the Napoleonic era, industrialisation and policies toward industrialisation connected with nationalism. The Revolutions of 1848 clearly demonstrated the revolutionary potential of nationalism. By mid-19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, nationalism had grown from its deeper roots to become entwined with the central political, economic, and social forces of modern times.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Nationalism?</b></i></span> Nationalism is a phenomenon of modern European history. It did not exist in recognisable form in the Middle Ages. At that time, the universalism of the Roman Empire lived in the Catholic Church, to which all Western Christians belonged, in the Latin language, which all educated people used, and in the Holy Roman Empire, ramshackle structure though it was. Therefore, mass allegiance to a nation during those centuries, was unknown. Instead, most men considered themselves to be, first of all, Christians, second, residents of a certain region such as Burgundy or Cornwall, and only last, if at all, French people or English people.</p>
<p class="indent">Three developments gradually modified this scale of allegiances. One was the rise of vernacular languages and the use of these languages for literary expression. Another was the break-off from the Catholic Church of several national churches. Finally, the Western European dynasties built and consolidated several large, homogeneous, independent states &ndash; England, France, Spain, Portugal, and Denmark. These developments laid the basis for the rise of nationalism, though until the late-18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>, century, a nation was identified with the person of the sovereign. Luther, for example, regarded 'the bishops and princes' as ‘Germany,’ while Louis XIV stated that the French nation ‘resided wholly in the person of the king.’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Rise and Grow?</b></i></span> Nationalism did not assume its modern form until the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, when the Western European bourgeoisie came to share or obtain full power. They did so in the name of the nation, so that the nation no longer was the king, his territory, and his subjects. Rather it was now composed of citizens (only propertied citizens until the late-19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century) 'who inhabited a common territory, possessed a voice in their common government, and were conscious of their common (imagined or real) heritage and their common interests.'</p>
<p class="indent">This modern form of nationalism received its greatest boost during the French Revolution and the Napoleonic period. In order to survive the onslaught of the old regimes of Europe, the revolutionary leaders were forced to mobilise national armies &ndash; armies of politically conscious citizens ready and eager to fight for their fatherland. The French Revolution contributed to the development of nationalism in several other ways. It required all French citizens to speak French &ndash; the central or national language &ndash; <a id="calibre_link-314" class="calibre10"></a>in place of the numerous regional dialects. It established a network of public elementary schools for the purpose of teaching French and love of country. The French Revolution also stimulated the publication of newspapers, pamphlets, and periodicals that were cheap and popularly written, and therefore effective in leaving their imprint upon the whole nation. It inaugurated such nationalist rites and symbols as the national flag, the national anthem, and national holidays. All these developments enabled nationalism to overcome people’s traditional commitments to religion and region.</p>
<p class="indent">We noted earlier that this passionate identification with one’s nation spread from France to neighbouring countries. It did so by the natural diffusion of nationalist ideology. Its spread was also a reaction to French aggression and domination. Nationalism was further stimulated by the industrial revolution which, with its new media (cheap newspapers, books, and leaflets) for mass communication, brought about a more effective and all-embracing indoctrination of citizens. Thus nationalism became a prime factor in European history in the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and in world history in the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>. Nationalism changed in character as the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century passed. It began as a humane and tolerant creed, based on the concept of the brotherhood rather than the rivalry of the various nationalist movements. In the latter part of the century, it became increasingly chauvinistic and militaristic because of the influence of social darwinism and the success of Bismarck in uniting Germany by Machiavellian diplomacy and war, or, as he put it, by “blood and iron.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nationalism manifested itself strongly, immediately after 1815 because the territorial settlement of that year left millions of peoples either disunited or under foreign rule. This was the case with the Germans, the Italians, the Belgians, the Norwegians, and the numerous nationalities of the Hapsburg and Ottoman empires. The inevitable result was a series of nationalist revolts that broke out in all parts of Europe after 1815. The Greeks revolted successfully in 1821, winning their independence from Turkish rule. The Belgians did likewise in 1830, breaking away from Dutch domination. The Italians, after futile uprisings in 1820, 1830, and 1848, established an independent and united state between 1859 and 1871. The Germans, under the leadership of Prussia, built their German Empire after defeating Austria in 1866 and France in 1870&ndash;71.</p>
<p class="indent">The principle of nationalism had triumphed in Western Europe by 1871. In Central and Eastern Europe the Hapsburg, Tsarist, and Ottoman empires remained 'prisons of nationalities.' The inmates of these prisons, however, were becoming increasingly ungovernable as nationalist movements succeeded all around them. The rulers of the three empires were aware of the consequences of nationalism for their multinational states, and tried to check it by various restrictive measures and by deliberately playing one subject nationality against another. These measures were successful at first but could not prevail indefinitely. The first breaches in the imperial structures were made by the Balkan subjects of the Turks. By 1878 the Serbs, the Rumanians, and the Montenegrins had gained their independence, and in 1908 the Bulgarians did likewise. Much more significant was the assassination in June 1914 of the Hapsburg Archduke Francis Ferdinand by a young Serbian patriot, Gavrilo Princip. This was the fateful event that precipitated World War I, whose outcome was the destruction of all the empires of Central and Eastern Europe &ndash; the German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Turkish. The peace treaties that terminated the war were generally based on the principle of nationalism, so that several new states appeared &ndash; Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Albania &ndash; that expressed the independent existence of hitherto subject <a id="calibre_link-315" class="calibre10"></a>peoples. For better or for worse, nationalism had triumphed throughout Europe with the conclusion of World War I. In the following decades, the idea of nationalism began to awaken and spur to action hundreds of millions of people in Europe’s overseas possessions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did Nationalism Rise?</b></i></span> Some of the factors which contributed to the rise and growth of nationalism in the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century can be seen in certain objective conditions such as:</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(a)</b></span>Common language, race and religion</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(b)</b></span>Common economic interests</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(c)</b></span>Common heritage or history</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(d)</b></span>Common political aspirations</p>
<p class="alist"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">(e)</b></span>Geographic contiguity and unity</p>
<p class="indent">Though these objective conditions are not indispensable, without some of these no unification process can truly begin.</p>
<p class="indent">Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, etc., in Germany, and Dante, Machiavelli, etc., in Italy, proved that a people can express their culture and ideas better with the help of a common language and literature. So, the members of a group speaking the same language naturally develop a feeling of oneness. It should, however, be noted that common language is not indispensable, as demonstrated by the Swiss people who speak different languages. Common economic interests are another important factor in this process. The <i class="calibre8">zolleverein</i>, for example, brought the Germans together in a customs union and this commercial unification later facilitated the political unification of Germany. Another contributory factor in national consolidation is the possession of common heritage or history. The Italians, especially, were proud of their history, and desired to repeat the feats of their Roman ancestors once again.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides the above basic conditions, the Revolutionary France (1789&ndash;95) played an important role in arousing national sentiment in Italy and Germany. Revolutionary France, apart from espousing the cause of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, also give a new fillip to the idea of nationalism by heroically defending herself against foreign aggression and intervention. This courageous demonstration of patriotism by the French had a profound effect on the minds of Italians and Germans.</p>
<p class="indent">The events of Napoleonic are equally significant in this respect. Since the disintegration of the Roman Empire, Italy had remained a mere 'geographical expression'. She was broken up into a number of small states which sometimes became easy prey to their more enterprising neighbours. Napoleon’s conquests, however, bought about for the first time in the modern period, the unification of Italy which only helped them to realise their strength when united. The Italians during his reign experienced a sense of national unity and felt a desire to preserve the legacy by putting an end to mutual jealousies.</p>
<p class="indent">Like wise, Napoleon’s activities kindled German Nationalism and paved way for the unification. To begin with, the complicated map of Germany with her 343 states was made simple by Napoleon. Hitherto the Hapsburg of Austria as the Holy Roman Emperors had nominal suzerainty over Germany, just as the Prussian king aspired for German leadership. Napoleon did not plan to bring the German lands under his direct control, but at the same time wanted to transform the German states into French protectorates and, thereby, reduce the influence of Austria and Prussia over them.</p>
<p class="indent">Immediately after the Treaty of Lunevelle (1801), he snatched away the independence of a large number of small states and distributed them among the larger states like Bavaria so that they might balance the influence of Prussia and Austria. The number of German states was, thus, brought down to 100 by this process of amalgamation.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-316" class="calibre10"></a>The situation was further improved after the defeat of Austria in the battle of Austerlitz (1805), when Napoleon decided to combine the German states into one entity under his presidency. A German union, termed as the 'Confederation of the Rhine', was created with Napoleon becoming its 'Protector'. Thus he finally managed to reduce the 300 odd states to just three&mdash;Austria, Prussia and the Confederation of the Rhine.</p>
<p class="indent">The abolition of the Holy Roman Empire followed the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine; Napoleon compelled the Austrian emperor to renounce the title of the ‘Holy Roman Emperor’. This had a great effect upon the future of Germany. Austria was always against the unification of Germany, for a united Germany would threaten her very existence. Now Napoleon almost achieved the apparently impossible feat of having a Germany without Austria in the process, strengthening the claims of Prussia for German leadership.</p>
<p class="indent">Above all, Napoleon engendered, though unintentionally, the spirit of nationalism among the Germans. As in the case of Italy, the artificial barriers were removed, evoking a sense of national unity among the Germans. This national spirit made the Germans realise the degradation they underwent during the foreign (French) domination. Finally, the national feeling resulted in the demand for the War of Liberation (1813), which was, in fact, forced upon the Prussian government by the people. Thus the complicated political map of Germany was made simple by Napoleon who drove away the Hapsburgs, roused the German national spirit (which was the prerequisite for the political unity of Germany) and finally facilitated the Prussian leadership of Germany.</p>
<p class="indent">Several other international events like the Spanish Nationalist War, the Battle of Nations against Napoleon, the heroic Greek War of Independence (1820s), the success of the French Revolution of 1830 and the Belgian Revolution for Independence (1830&ndash;31) together had made the Italians and Germans to realise the national unity and freedom and thus greatly influenced the course of growing nationalism in these countries.</p>
<p class="indent">A number of political thinkers and philosophers also played a great role in moulding the minds of the people of Italy and Germany. Italian poet, Dante (14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century), put forward his concept of universal monarchy. His main plea in favour of a universal Roman Empire is that God’s will is clearly evident in history and that the history of Rome showed her rise to place of supreme power had the signs of a providential guidance.</p>
<p class="indent">The Italian realist thinker Machiavelli (16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century) who believed in a 'citizen army' put forth the same idea of nationalism in a different shape. Patriotism and a desire for the unification of Italy and her defence from internal and external threats was the rationale of his citizen army. He held that duty to one’s country precedes all other duties and scruples. These noble ideas of Italian nationalism remained foremost in the hearts of Italian patriots through centuries seeking a convenient time to bloom forth in reality. The opportunity came in consecutive stages in 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries.</p>
<p class="indent">Italian nationalism got its further boost in the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century from the romanticism of the French philosopher, Rousseau. Rousseau’s ideas of city state and popular sovereignty stirred up a strong feeling that resulted mainly in idealising national patriotism. This affected Italy as much as other European countries. The newlyborn romantic sentiment together with the idea of nationalism paved the way for the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century Italian <i class="calibre8">Resorgimento</i> (Resurrection).</p>
<p class="indent">The manner in which romantic spirit made way for German nationalism is borne out by Kant, Goethe, Hegel, etc., in Germany. The romantic version of nationalism in Germany has more depth than that of Italy, because in <a id="calibre_link-317" class="calibre10"></a>later days the non-rational approach to reality and truth was further increased by the writings of Trietsche.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-39"><b class="calibre9">UNIFICATION OF ITALY AND GERMANY</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Italian people were disappointed when the Congress of Vienna divided their country into provinces. Only the kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, which included Savoy, was under Italian control. Lombardy and Venetia were annexed to Austria. Dominated by Austria were other areas in Italy including the two Sicilies, which contained Naples and the Island of Sicily. The Pope controlled the Papal States across central Italy. Although a spirit of nationalism and unification developed among Italians, Austria and the Pope fought to keep control of their lands.</p>
<p class="indent">A nationalist society, Young Italy, was founded in 1831 by Giuseppe Mazzini. In 1852, another nationalist Count Cavour was named premier of Sardinia-Piedmont. The House of Savoy and King Victor Emmanuel II, ruler of Sardinia, backed Cavour’s plans to unify Italy. In 1855, Cavour sent Sardinian troops to support the French in the Crimean war. France in return for Nice and Savoy pledged to aid Sardinia if Austria could be tricked into an attack. Cavour mobilised Sardinian troops causing Austria to issue an ultimatum and then declare war. French and Sardinian troops defeated the Austrians. Austria ceded Lombardy to France and then to Sardinia. Sardinia gave Nice and Savoy to France. Immediately many Italian states overthrew their royal governments and voted to join Sardinia.</p>
<p class="indent">Giuseppe Garibaldi, a nationalist military leader in Sardinia backed by Cavour, sailed from Piedmont in 1860, leading 1000 volunteer soldiers known as Red Shirts. He took control of Sicily and Southern Italy and marched toward Rome. Fearing that Garibaldi might take control for himself, Cavour sent an army through Northern Italy to head him off and attack the Papal States. These were annexed, except for Rome. The kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in 1861.</p>
<p class="indent">Italy joined with Prussia in its seven weeks war against Austria. In the treaty, Austria was forced to give Venetia to Italy (1866). When French forces protecting Rome were withdrawn in 1870, Italian troops took that city. The Pope was left with only the Vatican area. Rome was chosen as the capital of the newly unified Italy.</p>
<p class="indent">The unification of the German states into a single powerful nation came through the diplomatic scheming of principally one man, Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor to the Prussian King. At the time of the French Revolution, Germany was composed of 343 independent states. Most had been loosely allied in the Holy Roman Empire. Napoleon ended the empire when he formed the Confederation of the Rhine.</p>
<p class="indent">Germany was still split into the larger Catholic states grouped around Austria in the South and the Northern Protestant states who looked to Prussia’s leadership. Austria feared the growth of Prussia, while Prussia wanted a union of German states without Austria. In 1819, Prussia set up the <i class="calibre8">zollverein,</i> a trade system that lifted tariffs among member German states. Except for Austria, most of the other German states became used to working with Prussia.</p>
<p class="indent">After William I became the new Prussian King in 1861, the Prussian Parliament refused to grant him his army credits. Angered, he called Bismarck to run his government and collect his taxes. Bismarck desired a unified Germany under Prussian leadership without Austria. After taking over the Danish provinces of Schelswig-Holstein, he next got French and Italian pledges of neutrality. In 1865 he caused Austria, disturbed over difficulties in Holstein <a id="calibre_link-318" class="calibre10"></a>and over other Prussian actions, to declare war. The Prussian army quickly crushed Austria (1866) and Prussia took control of the Central German states.</p>
<p class="indent">France, wanting to humiliate the growing Prussia, tried to prevent the German prince from becoming king of Spain. Bismarck, by rewriting a telegram between the French and the Prussian king, made both feel insulted. France declared war, but the Prussian army overran France, even taking Louis Napoleon prisoner. All the German states that fought with Prussia now joined in making the Prussian king their Emperor (Kaiser). A new constitution in 1870 completed the unification of Germany, giving it democracy and much efficiency, but most power went to Kaiser and Chancellor Bismarck.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How and When did Italian Unification Take Place?</b></i></span> In the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, Italian nationalism resulted in the rise of the Italian <i class="calibre8">Resorgimento</i> (Resurrection) in three different forms: a) federalist idea of unification of Italy under Pope; b) republican idea of unification; and c) the idea of unification under a constitutional monarch. All the efforts of Italian patriots prior to 1850 had been nullified by the existence of the above three divergent views as to the best method of realising their common aspiration. Mazzini favoured a republic; Giobarty was for a federation of the Italian states under the Presidency of the Pope; while the third party desired the union of Italy under the House of Savoy, that is, the King of Piedmont.</p>
<p class="indent">After the events of 1848&ndash;49, both federalism and republicanism were no longer considered as possible answers of the Italian question. Besides, the transformation of the reforming Pope, Pius XI, into a reactionary proved to be a stumbling block to the political unification of Italy. He was suspicious that the establishment of a strong secular government would decrease his own spiritual influence and compromise his position in the eyes of the non-Italian nations. Therefore, from 1849 onwards, he proved to be an antithesis to the national cause and made every possible attempt to prevent Italian unity. Likewise, republicanism lost its credibility. It was too radical to attract the masses, and failure of Mazzini’s efforts in Rome made it a spent force. With the two rival plans out of the picture, the issue was simplified and the only solution that attracted the attention of the nationalists was the establishment of a constitutional kingdom under the king of Sardinia-Piedmont.</p>
<p class="indent">There were a number of causes for the Italian nationalists to look to the Piedmont as the nucleus of a future Italy:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">1.</b></span>Piedmont was the only Italian state that had never been under the control of Austria.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">2.</b></span>Her king was the only representative of the native Italian dynasty.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">3.</b></span>It was Piedmont that had in 1848&ndash;49 fought wholeheartedly against the Austrians and her dynasty alone had proved to be zealous of the national cause.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">4.</b></span>In spite of heavy pressure from the victorious Austrians, Victor Emmanuel II retained the constitution which his father had granted.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the only Italian state, with a constitution, to become a liberal oasis in the desert of despotism was Piedmont. She become the beacon of liberty and attracted the attention of nationalists in other places. Taking into account the risk she had braved and the sacrifices she had made, Piedmont stood out as the leader of the nationalist movement, and every kind of nationalist began to realise the fact that Italy could be made only a constitutional monarchy under the House of Savoy.</p>
<p class="indent">Luckily for Italy, Sardinia-Piedmont was then ruled by an enlightened and capable king, Victor Emmanuel II, who in turn was helped by his shrewd and efficient Prime Minister, Count <a id="calibre_link-319" class="calibre10"></a>Cavour. Cavour wanted to make Sardinia an ideally governed state and thus make all Italians accept her leadership. Through a series of radical reforms, he improved every branch of administration&mdash;ecclesiastical, civil, fiscal and military. Sardinia was now on the way to material prosperity. At the same time, Cavour, while rejecting the insurrectionary methods of Mazzini, believed that force alone could drive Austria out of Italy and was feasible only with the help of outside powers. Hence he was on the lookout for acquiring allies for Italy.</p>
<p class="indent">Consequently, he grabbed the opportunity presented by the Crimean War and joined England and France against Russia. In the Paris Peace Conference, he succeeded in gaining international sympathy for Italy. Most important was the success of Cavour in winning over Napoleon III to his cause and they signed a treaty in 1858 by which Napoleon agreed to help Italy in return for Savoy and Nice.</p>
<p class="indent">Piedmont’s triumph in the war with Austria was the first step in the unification of Italy. Annoyed by the military preparations of Cavour, Austria declared war on Sardinia. Napoleon III personally led a French army into Italy. The Austrians were defeated at Salferino and Magenta (1859). Napoleon abruptly ceased hostilities and negotiated the peace of Villafranca (1859), which was thrust on the unwilling Italians. However, Austria was forced to part with Lombardy to Sardinia by this treaty.</p>
<p class="indent">The Sardinia success against Austria, albeit with French help, raised the hopes of the Italians. People of Tuscany, Modena, Parma and Romagna, in particular, drove away their princes and declared for amalgamation with Sardinia. Having appeased Napoleon III by the cession of Nice and Savoy, Victor Emmanuel bowed to the will of the people and merged those states into Sardinia (March, 1860).</p>
<p class="indent">The conquest of the two Southern states of Italy&mdash;Sicily and Naples (1860)&mdash;was achieved by Garibaldi, the soldier hero of Italian unity. With covert help from Mazzini and Cavour, Garibaldi invaded and conquered Sicily with the help of his 'Red Shirts'. He went over to the mainland Italy and conquered Naples, after which he decided to strike Rome itself. Taking advantage of an insurrection in Rome, Cavour gained the permission of Napoleon and occupied the Papal States, excepting Rome. Emmanuel II then marched against Naples, where Garibaldi resigned his authority into the hands of Emmanuel. It was a fine example of selfless sacrifice by Garibaldi.</p>
<p class="indent">Emmanuel after bringing the major part of Italy under his control crowned himself king of Italy (1861). In the same year, the first Italian Parliament met at Turin. Still Venetia remained under the domination of Austria and Rome was independent under the Pope, defended by a French garrison. Two international wars had to be fought before they were annexed to Italy. Cavour did not live to see the complete unification of Italy since he passed away in 1861 itself.</p>
<p class="indent">On the eve of the Austro-Prussian War (1866), Emmanuel II supported Bismarck and fought against Austria. The Italians suffered serious setbacks against the Austrians. Their army was defeated at Custozza, while their navy was destroyed at Lissa. However, the Prussian victory at Sadowa over Austrians made good the Italian defeat. In the Treaty of Prague, Bismarck forced Austria to cede Venetia to the Italians.</p>
<p class="indent">On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon III called back the French forces from Rome. Victor Emmanuel grabbed the opportunity and took over Rome which was immediately made the capital of united Italy. The unification of Italy was, thus, completed due to Mazzini’s moral enthusiasm, Garibaldi’s sword, Cavour ’s diplomacy and Victor Emmanuel’s tact and good sense.</p>

<p class="caption">Italian Unification</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was The Role of Italian Personalities?</b></i></span> Mazzini, the prophet and apostle of Italian unity, contributed immensely to the growth and nourishment of Italian nationalism. He was a secular political thinker and a staunch republican who wanted unified Italy to be a republic with liberal institutions and laws. For his republican ideas, he was exited from <a id="calibre_link-321" class="calibre10"></a>his motherland. He instilled into the Italian national movement a moral zeal, which had been so far missing, aroused the enthusiasm of the people, especially the young, and kept alive the spirit of insurrection. The moral nature of his appeal made it irresistible. In the beginning, Mazzini was a Carbonari (member of a secret society). Soon he realized that Carbonarism was not going to triumph and young Italy soon displaced the Carbonari as the centre of nationalist movement. It believed that Renaissance was a necessary prerequisite for a revolution to be successful. The greatest contribution of Mazzini and the young Italy was to give a definite form to the idea of nationalism and to transform the idea into a popular cause.</p>
<p class="indent">Garibaldi, another prominent personality, was a man of action and hence he is regarded as the sword of Italian nationalism and unification. Placing his services at the beck and call of his country, he never missed an opportunity to strike a blow for its freedom. He relied on the sword to free Italy, not understanding either compromise or political necessities. Though his impetuosity was at times a source of great embarrassment to Cavour, it should be noticed that it was he who carved a way and with a rare selflessness handed over the fruits of his victory to Victor Emmanuel II. He was a republican, yet he not only fought under the king of Sardinia but supported, against his own beliefs, the union of Italy under that crown. His love for the country outweighed even his convictions.</p>
<p class="indent">Cavour was the most powerful single factor in the unification of Italy. It was he who successfully completed the work begun by Mazzini and Garibaldi and he did with a wisdom and statesmanship which none of them possessed. He was the masterbrain which converted the inspiration of Mazzini into a diplomatic force and turned the sword of Garibaldi into a national weapon. For his sound judgement and successful diplomacy, the idealism of Mazzini and the illguided enthusiasm of Garibaldi would have added another chapter to the history of blasted hopes and fruitless struggle.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition there was another personality whose must be mentioned with glory in the context of Italian <i class="calibre8">Risorgimento</i>. It was the name of Victor Emmanuel II, the king of Sardinia-Piedmont. His serene nature, common sense in great crises, his powers of military organisation, his frankness and, above all, his loyal support to his ministers, proved to be of priceless help to his country’s emancipation. Without his support, Cavour could not have accomplished what he did.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was German Unification Done?</b></i></span> In Germany the origin of nationalism can be traced to the struggle with Napoleon. After the Battle of Waterloo the German liberals aimed at the reorganisation of Germany on a national basis. Their desire for a free, united Germany was thwarted when the reactionary Congress of Vienna made Germany a confederation of 19 states with the Emperor of Austria as its President. The disappointment of the liberals was boundless.</p>
<p class="indent">No reactionary settlement could arrest the spirit of freedom and nationalism when once kindled. The history of Germany for 50 years since the Vienna Congress was history of two movements&mdash;one democratic and the other national in character. The goal of the first movement was the establishment of popular government, while that of the second was German unity. For a time the forces of reaction were victorious in Germany. Most of the rulers of the German states were against any scheme of reforms and, under the direction of Metternich they did everything possible to arrest popular movements. As a result, when the July Revolution (1830) in Paris sent a sympathetic thrill throughout Germany, the popular movements were ruthlessly suppressed by the reactionary princes. Something was gained for the cause of liberalism as several of <a id="calibre_link-322" class="calibre10"></a>the minor German states granted constitutions to their subjects.</p>
<p class="indent">It was during the revolutionary period that the first step towards German unity was taken through the creation of <i class="calibre8">zollvereins</i> or customs unions. These were in the form of commercial treaties by which the different states of the German Confederation, expect Austria, agreed to introduce a policy of free trade among them by removing the customs, duties which were levied on goods passing from one state to another. Thus, even before German political unity had come within the range of practical politics, nearly the whole of Germany had achieved a commercial unity from which Austria was excluded. The commercial union led the people to think in terms of a complete union.</p>
<p class="indent">The triumph of the French Revolution of 1848 kindled new hopes in Germany, but these were soon extinguished by the refusal of the Prussian king, Frederick William IV, to accept the crown of united Germany, offered by a revolutionary parliament which had met at Frankfurt. The Prussian king subsequently made an attempt to unite the states of north Germany by a federal constitution under the presidency of Prussia, but it was frustrated by the hostile stand of Austria. Though the movement petered out, the Prussian king granted a constitution to his people.</p>
<p class="indent">The main hindrance to German unity was, thus, the jealousy of Austria which was strongly opposed to any reorganisation of Germany aimed at elevation of the position of Prussia. When Frederick William died and his brother ascended the throne as Williams Kaiser I, things began to look different. The new monarch was eager for reform, but the Prussian assembly obstructed his plans of reform. William I, therefore, appointed Bismarck, an ardent supporter of monarchy, as his Chief Minister and thus inaugurated a new chapter in German history.</p>
<p class="indent">War with Denmark (1863&ndash;68), which was the first of his series of wars, was the outcome of what is known as the Schelswig-Holstein question. The King of Denmark, being the Duke of these two duchies, wanted to annex them permanently to his kingdom. Bismarck was against this plan and in union with Austria declared war against Denmark and forced her to give up her claim to the duchies. Henceforth, the duchies became a bone of contention between the victors, Austria and Prussia. Bismarck was firm on annexing them, while Austria was determined that her rival should not acquire them.</p>
<p class="indent">The prolonged disputes that followed were skilfully handled by Bismarck to declare war against Austria. The Austro-Prussian War that followed was no longer for the two duchies but for the leadership of Germany. At Sadowa, the Austrians were humiliated. By the peace which followed, Austria withdrew from Germany and agreed to allow Prussia to reorganise the German states according to her plan.</p>
<p class="indent">After overcoming the main hurdle for German unity, Bismarck now began to reorganise Germany. Those states of the North which had opposed Prussia were annexed to Prussia. The remaining states of North Germany retained their independence, but were bound together in the North German Confederation under the presidency of Prussia. This was a great leap towards German unity.</p>
<p class="indent">The process of unification had still to take effect on the states of the South. There were two hurdles in the way. First, the Southern states were envious of Prussia and were not inclined to entering a confederation in which Prussia was overbearing. Secondly, there was the opposition of France which viewed with open jealousy the rise of the new Prussian power. Bismarck’s policy was to overcome these hurdles by a deliberately provoked war with France. He wanted to wage a national war in order to create a national feeling which would tie together all the German states&mdash;Northern <a id="calibre_link-323" class="calibre10"></a>and Southern&mdash;for a common goal. His chance came when in 1869 the Spanish throne fell vacant and Leopold of Hohenzollern, a distant relative of the Prussia king, was offered the throne. The opposition of Napoleon III of France against it made Leopold to withdraw his candidature. This alone did not satisfy Napoleon and he demanded that the Prussian king should give surety that no member of the Hohenzollern family should ever contend for the Spanish throne. The Prussian king gave a polite no but Bismarck by a falsified telegram produced the impression that the French ambassador had been insulted and harshly sent beck by the Prussian king. This ignited the passion of the French people and the war which Bismarck so eagerly awaited was in sight. The French suffered a heavy defeat at Sedan and the patriotic pride resulting from this victory led the Southern states of Germany to join North German Confederation. Thus, the ruler of Prussia, King William I, was declared the Emperor of united Germany in 1871.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How do the Two Unifications Compare?</b></i></span> A comparison of the unification of Italy with that of Germany would make an interesting study. There are quite a few similarities between the two, at least on the exterior:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">1.</b></span>The central subject was the same in both cases.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">2.</b></span>Both began the period in disunity, made futile efforts to attain goal on 1848, and ultimately achieved it almost simultaneously and as the consequence of the national operations.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">3.</b></span>In both cases, the most powerful states acted as the leaders of the national movement.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">4.</b></span>The desired goal in both cases was attained chiefly due to the capabilities of their respective Prime Ministers.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">5.</b></span>Both had to override the resistance of Austria as a necessary prerequisite to the achievement of their goal.</p>
<p class="indent">The above resemblances were however, only on the surface, because the problems which the two had to face were qualitatively as well as quantitatively distinct as also the ideas and modes they adopted to solve them.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">1.</b></span>In certain respects, Cavour’s problems were greater compared to those of Bismarck.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">2.</b></span>The relative weakness of Sardinia- Piedmont made foreign aid necessary for achieving Italian unification, while Bismarck just needed the neutrality of other European powers.</p>
<p class="indent">Piedmont was only a trifle more powerful than other Italian states, while Prussia already had a commanding position in Germany due to the formation of <i class="calibre8">zollverein</i> with Prussia as its head and also due to the reorganisation of the Prussian army by William I.</p>
<p class="indent">In other ways, however, Bismarck’s difficulties were greater compared to those of Cavour.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">1.</b></span>Bismarck had to face a stiffer opposition from local forces than Cavour, because German particularism was more deep-rooted than the Italian.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">2.</b></span>Diplomatic problems of Bismarck were greater than those of Cavour, because Austrian expulsion from Germany was bound to kick up a greater furore in Europe than her expulsion from Italy.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">3.</b></span>Bismarck had to do it single handed, whereas Cavour built with stones quarried largely by others (Mazzini and Garibaldi).</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">4.</b></span>Bismarck had a more trying time than Cavour in obtaining the consent of his king for his policy.</p>
<p class="indent">The ideals and policies adopted by Cavour were also different from those of Bismarck.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">1.</b></span>Cavour was a liberal and staunch parliamentarian, while Bismarck was a reactionary, opponent of parliaments and a proponent of force.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-324" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00053.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Maps of German Unification</p>
<p class="list"><span class="space"><b class="calibre9">2.</b></span>Cavour was an Italian first and then a Sardinian, whereas Bismarck was a Prussian first and then a German.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of these differences in ideals and principles, the element of force is more conspicuous in Bismarck’s methods than in Cavour’s.</p>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How Did Germany Develop Between 1871 and 1914?</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent">The creation of the German Empire by Bismarck’s blood-and-iron method, its autocratic constitution (despite the establishment of universal male suffrage), and its strong-handed leadership, first by the Iron Chancellor and then by Kaiser Wilhelm II, guaranteed that the German Empire would be an enlarged Prussia. The German Empire possessed a powerful army, a large, energetic, and disciplined population, a rapidly growing industrial machine, a fervent and restless national spirit. Bismarck ruled over his creation as chancellor for almost 20 years.</p>
<p class="indent">His first concern after the defeat of France and the declaration of the empire in 1870&ndash;1871 was to complete the consolidation and nationalisation of the German states and people. The law codes, the currencies, and the military forces of the <a id="calibre_link-325" class="calibre10"></a>25 lesser states were brought into conformity with those of Prussia. Banking and railroads were placed under control of the national government. The empire’s spawning industry was protected against British competition by a high tariff. The French in Alsace-Lorraine, the Danes in Schleswig, and more than 3 million Poles in the Eastern districts were pressured to give up their language and traditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Two other groups in Germany excited Bismarck’s suspicion and wrath: the Roman Catholics and the Socialists. Any German who had a foreign loyalty was intolerable to Bismarck. From 1872 to 1878, Bismarck waged a political power struggle with the Roman Catholics that came to be called the <i class="calibre8">Kulturkampf</i> (battle for civilisation). The Jesuits were expelled, civil marriage was made compulsory, and education, including that of Roman Catholic priests, was brought under state control and largely secularised. When the Roman Catholic clergy and most of the laity, which constituted approximately one-third of the total German population, resisted and rallied to the Pope, hundreds of priests and six bishops were arrested. It was all to no avail. The Roman Catholic Centre Party in the Reichstag became stronger, and by 1878, Bismarck wanted its support for what he considered to be a struggle of greater importance &ndash; that against the Socialists. In 1878 upon the accession of a more conciliatory pope, Leo XIII, Bismarck went to Canossa and had the most severe of the anti-Catholic legislation repealed.</p>
<p class="indent">In the same year, he began a 12 year crusade against the internationally minded Socialists. He outlawed their publications, their organisations, and their meetings, and set the German police force upon them. He only drove them underground. Throughout the 1880s, Bismarck sought to undercut the Socialists’ appeal to the working class by setting up a comprehensive system of social insurance. Accident, sickness, and old-age insurance was provided for the industrial proletariat, the funds being raised by compulsory contributions from the workers, the employers, and the state. Although Bismarck’s motives were not benevolent or humanitarian, his measures gave impetus to a trend toward state responsibility for social security. Nevertheless, the Socialists were not appeased, and Bismarck continued to fight them as long as he remained chancellor.</p>
<p class="indent">Bismarck’s foreign policy after 1871 was one of security and retrenchment. He knew that France would be unforgiving and revengeful, forever seeking an opportunity to regain Alsace and Lorraine. Of France alone he had little fear, but France in league with other powers; particularly Russia and Great Britain, would be formidable. Therefore, his consistent policy was to maintain a close military alliance with Austria-Hungary and cordial relations with Russia and Great Britain. In 1873, Bismarck formed the Three Emperor’s League among Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia. When the interests of Austria-Hungary and Russia proved to be incompatible, this league was replaced in 1879&ndash;1882 by the Triple Alliance among Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. A separate ‘reinsurance treaty’ of friendship and neutrality was made with Russia. Bismarck did not depend wholly on diplomacy. Throughout this period, the German military machine was made even more powerful.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1888 Wilhelm II (1888&ndash;1918) became Kaiser. Wilhelm II was 29 nine years of age when he ascended the throne. He had been brought up in the army, which was his first love. Egotistical and bombastic by nature, he was a dabbler in theology, history, and the arts and gave advice and instructions freely to the leading figures in those fields. He was also an eloquent and willing speaker and had his generous and humanitarian moments.</p>
<p class="indent">The young Kaiser’s personality and policies soon clashed with those of Bismarck. In 1890, just two years after he became emperor, Wilhelm <a id="calibre_link-326" class="calibre10"></a>II accepted Bismarck’s reluctant resignation as chancellor. The immediate cause of the break was a disagreement over the control of the ministry and the repeal of the anti-Socialist laws, which Bismarck wished to be continued. The real reason, however, was that there was simply not room enough in Germany for two such prima donnas. Bismarck’s foreign policy was quickly reversed.</p>
<p class="indent">The reinsurance treaty with Russia was immediately allowed to lapse, as the Kaiser assumed a keen interest in extending German hegemony over the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire, areas the Russians considered to be vital to their own interests and ambitions. In 1894, Russia formed an alliance with France, the very thing that Bismarck had worked so hard to prevent. Wilhelm II also soon alienated Great Britain. His extension of German influence in the Near East, particularly his Berlin-to-Baghdad railroad project, threatened an area in which Great Britain had many vital interests and through which ran its 'lifeline' to India and the Far East. In China, too, German interests began to rival those of the British.</p>
<p class="indent">It was Kaiser’s naval policy, however, that alarmed the British the most. Wilhelm was an ardent and lifelong navalist. “The waves beat powerfully at our national gates,” he cried, “and call us as a great nation to maintain our place in the world ...” Germany’s 'place in the sun' was a favourite phrase of the Hohen-zollern emperor. The Reichstag voted an enormous naval building program that was steadily increased until in 1908 it called for 28 new battleships of the biggest and latest design. The purpose of this program was to give Germany a battle fleet so great that “a war against the mightiest naval power would endanger the supremacy of that power.”</p>
<p class="indent">Great Britain, whose food supply as well as her empire depended on naval supremacy, took utmost alarm. Failing in efforts to reach an understanding with Kaiser’s government, Britain launched a huge and costly naval building program of its own. In 1904 Britain joined France, and in 1907 Russia, in the Triple Entente, which was in reality a defensive military alliance. The interests and policies of Great Britain, France, and Russia had long been so discordant that nothing less than maximum alarm could have brought them together. Thus in 17 years Wilhelm had undone Bismarck’s work and brought about the 'encirclement' of the fatherland by three of the world’s greatest powers.</p>
<p class="indent">Germany’s economic exploits under Bismarck and Wilhelm II were no less phenomenal than those in the military realm. In 1871, Great Britain was the world’s leading nation in manufacturing and commerce; the Industrial Revolution was still in its early stages in Germany. By 1914, Germany was a close second to Great Britain in industry and commerce; in many areas, such as the production of steel and machinery, Germany had far outstripped Britain. In the up-and-coming chemical and electrical industries and in scientific agriculture and forestry, Germany was far advanced from all other nations. Germany was also first in the application of science to industry and in industrial and scientific research. By 1914, the German merchant marine had captured the lion’s share of the lucrative transatlantic passenger traffic.</p>
<p class="indent">At a time when other industrial nations, particularly the United States, were beginning to restrict the giant monopolistic trusts, the German imperial government was encouraging and subsidising its cartels in order that they might compete more effectively with foreign companies. More and more of the world’s market was captured by German business. “Made in Germany” became a familiar mark from the Andean plateau to the Congo jungles. Germany’s population, keeping pace with its economy, increased from 41 million in 1871 to 65 million in 1914. Meanwhile, heavy emigration <a id="calibre_link-327" class="calibre10"></a>(which had reached a peak in the 1880s of some 250,000 a year, most of it to the United States) dwindled to a mere trickle. In 1914, the number of German emigrants was less than the number of workers coming into Germany from neighbouring countries. Only the United States was keeping pace with Germany in overall economic advancement.</p>
<p class="indent">The industrialisation of Germany, although accompanied by the growth of a large and prosperous bourgeoisie, did not produce a tide of liberalism as it had in other Western industrialised nations. The middle classes allied themselves with the conservative government. Only the Social Democratic Party (working class) and the small and weak Progressive Party (intellectuals, professionals, and small-business people) advocated liberal or radical reforms. Even the Social Democratic Party, by 1914 the largest party in the empire, was inundated by the flood of nationalism that welled up during the international crises that preceded World War I.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-40"><b class="calibre9">DISINTEGRATION OF EMPIRES THROUGH EMERGENCE OF NATIONALITIES</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Nationalism between 1871 and 1914 pulled the Austrian and Ottoman empires apart along language lines. After Austria’s defeat by Prussia in 1866, the dominant German minority in Austria felt obliged to take into partnership the aggressive and restless Magyars of Hungary. The <i class="calibre8">Ausgleich</i> (compromise) of 1867 set up the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Each country had its own separate parliament. But the two were united under a common ruler, the head of the house of Hapsburg; common ministries of war, finance, and foreign affairs; and joint delegations from the two parliaments whose duty was to coordinate policies, wherever possible. This arrangement was essentially an alliance between the Germans of Austria and the Magyars of Hungary against the Slavic, Rumanian, and Italian language groups, which constituted a majority of the total population of the dual monarchy. In effect, the Germans said to the Magyars: “You take care of your subject language groups [mostly Slavs] and we will take care of ours”.</p>
<p class="indent">Austria followed a relatively moderate policy in dealing with its subject language groups. Cultural autonomy was granted, and the suffrage was gradually extended until in 1907 all adult males were given the vote. However, the subject people were more interested in nationalism than in democracy. The various language groups developed images of a glorious cultural and political past. The prosperous Czechs of Bohemia were especially adamant. The problem was confounded by the fact that many language groups had kinsmen outside the dual monarchy whom they wished to join and who deliberately stirred up their disloyalty. Such groups were the Italians, the Poles, the Ruthenians (Ukrainians), the Serbs, and the Rumanians. Parliamentary sessions in Austria frequently degenerated into shouting, inkstand-throwing melees among the various language groups. Moreover anti-semitism was growing in Austria, a development not unrelated to these problems among different ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="indent">Hungary made no pretence of conciliation. The Magyar aristocracy ruled over Slovak, Rumanian, Serb, and Croat minorities with an iron hand. The aristocracy also refused to permit its own Magyar masses to participate in the government. The nationalist discontent in Hungary was even greater than it was in Austria; the Yugo (southern) Slavs (Croats and Serbs) were particularly troublesome. This explosive nationalism threatened to blow the Austro-Hungarian monarchy apart and, because of the network of entangling alliances, to draw the other major powers into a world conflict.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-328" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00083.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Linguistic Groups of Austria-Hungary</p>
<p class="indent">The Balkan portion of the Ottoman Empire between 1871 and 1914 was a hornets’ nest of nationalism. The hatred of the Christian Balkan language groups for their Moslem Turkish masters was equalled only by their distrust for each other. The once potent Ottoman Empire crumbled throughout the course of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, and one Balkan language group after another, now aflame with national pride and ambition, emerged as an independent nation. Meanwhile, all the great powers of Europe became involved in the strategic and troubled area of the Near East. Russia, Austria-Hungary, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy had important imperial, economic, and military interests in the Balkans. In addition, Russia and Austria- Hungary had serious nationalistic interests there. Russia considered itself the big brother and protector of the Slavic-speaking Serbs and Bulgarians. Austria-Hungary’s large Rumanian and Yugoslav populations desired union with their free kinsmen in Rumania and Serbia. Between 1829 and 1913 first the Greeks, then the Serbs, Rumanians, and Bulgarians, and finally the Albanians gained their independence from the Ottoman Empire. In each case, a major crisis occurred among the great powers. These Balkan crises became progressively more severe, until finally one crisis got out of control and exploded into World War I.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is its Background?</b></i></span> The Ottoman Empire enjoyed a supreme position in the Islamic world for over 600 years. Originally a nomadic tribe from central Asia, the Ottoman Turks gradually moved into the Islamic world in the Middle East. Their leader, Ottoman, gave them a political status. Having served as the slaves of the Sultans, the Turkish mercenaries moved into the interiors of Arabia and ultimately overthrew the Caliphs of Baghdad in the 13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. With remarkable speed, they also brought a part of Europe under the control of the Ottoman emperor. The Ottoman Empire included most of the Middle East in the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and was a cauldron of different peoples, cultures, religions and conflicting loyalties. The Empire was organised as a theocracy on the basis of ecclesiastical communities rather than ethnic groups. These communities, the most important of which were the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Jewish, were allowed considerable autonomy under their respective ecclesiastical leaders. Thus, for centuries the Muslim people (Turks, Arabs, Kurds, Albanians, etc) lived side by side with the Christian people (Serbs, Greeks, Bulgars and Rumanians) in semi-autonomous and self-sufficient communities. Non-Muslims did suffer some discrimination regarding dress, behaviour, living areas and higher taxes, but each community was allowed its own church, schools, language and local government as long as it accepted the authority of the emperor and paid taxes to his treasury. Because of this loose imperial organisation, Western ideas and pressures encountered a variety of cultures and conditions. As a result of this, the impact of the West on the Ottoman Empire was not uniform. Therefore, inanalysing the nature of that impact, it is important to take into account the marked variations in regional conditions and responses. For this reason we shall consider, not the Ottoman Empire as a whole, but rather its two main regions; the Balkan Peninsula with a predominantly Christian population and Asia Minor with its ruling Turkish population.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-329" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00110.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Austro-Hungarian Empire</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-330" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did Balkan Nationalism Rise?</b></i></span> The Balkan peoples were ruled by the Turks for nearly four centuries, but the various Balkan people vastly outnumbered the few Turks living in their midst. They lived in small groups and retained their own languages and religions. A revolt from such a group could have caused a lot of trouble for the Turks. But the Turks, during the early centuries, had no more trouble ruling their Christian subjects in the Balkans than they did ruling their Muslim subjects in Asia.</p>
<p class="indent">This relative peace was possible, it is said, because the Turkish rulers were benevolent and efficient compared to the Byzantine rulers and the Bulgarian and Serb princes who had once ruled the Balkans. Ottoman rule was stern, yet just; taxation was light, and non-Muslim enjoyed a degree of tolerance unparalleled in Christian Europe. But there was a drastic change in the situation during the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries. Ottoman power and efficiency declined leading to wide-spread corruption and extortion, which in turn drove the now oppressed and embittered Balkan Christians to take up arms in self-defence. At the same time, Balkan people were being affected and aroused by a variety of western influences. The West affected and influenced the Balkans earlier and more profoundly than any other ethnic group in the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p class="indent">Being mostly Christians, they were more receptive to the Christian West than the Muslim Arabs and Turks. The geographical contiguity of Europe and the Balkans also made it easier for persons, ideas and goods to converge upon the Balkans from across the Danube and the Adriatic, Mediterranean and Black Seas. The growing demand for food imports in West Europe stimulated agriculture in the Balkans. The export of these commodities in turn led to the growth of a native Balkan mercantile class and mariners. This trade expansion also boosted the demand and output of handicrafts. Major manufacturing centres appeared in various parts of the peninsula. The rise of commerce and industry promoted the growth of a merchant marine along the Adriatic coast and amongst the Aegean Islands.</p>
<p class="indent">This new economic situation created a middle class of merchants, artisans, shipowners and mariners which was sympathetic to Western ideas and institutions. These people were dissatisfied with Ottoman rule which had become inefficient and corrupt. Mariners and merchants who travelled abroad contrasted the Enlightenment and security they witnessed in foreign lands with the squalor and deplorable conditions at home, and concluded that their own future and that of the Balkan people depended on the removal of the Turkish rule. <a id="calibre_link-331" class="calibre10"></a>An intellectual awakening began with the help of Serbian merchants in Southern Hungary, Bulgarian merchants in Southern Russia, and Greek merchants scattered in the major cities of Europe. This was achieved by the publication of books and newspapers in their native languages, by establishing schools and villages and by sending young men to foreign universities. This meant a shift in the kind of education too&mdash;no longer was it purely religious. Instead, it was profoundly influenced by the Enlightenment in Western Europe. During the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Era, the influence of the West in the Balkans became directly political and inflammatory. The uprisings in Paris, the slogan of “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity” and the spectacle of Napoleon toppling one dynasty after another made a profound impression on the politically conscious sections of the Balkans.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did It Rise and Grow?</b></i></span> The pace of national awakening, however, varied greatly from one Balkan people to another. The Greeks were the first&mdash;their frequent contacts with the West, their classical Byzantine heritage which stimulated national pride, and their Greek Orthodox Church which represented and preserved national pride contributed to the early awakening. The Serbs, who enjoyed a high degree of local self-government as well as the stimulating influence of the large Serbian settlements in Southern Hungary, came next. These advantages of the Greeks and Serbs suggest the reasons for the slower rate of national revival among the Balkan peoples. The Bulgars had no direct ties with the West and were located near the Ottoman capital and the solid Turkish settlements in Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. The Rumanians suffered from a sharp social stratification which was unique in the Balkans and which produced a cultivated upper class and an inert peasant mass. The Albanians were the worst off, with their primitive tribal organisation and their division among three creeds&mdash;Orthodoxy, Catholicism and Islam.</p>
<p class="indent">These factors explain why there were separate uprisings ranging from the early 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century to the early 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, instead of a common Balkan revolution against the Ottoman rule. The Greeks won complete independence from the Turks following the protracted War of Independence between 1821 and 1829. The Serbs, who revolted earlier in 1804, succeeded only in gaining an autonomous status within the Ottoman Empire in 1815. It was only in 1878 that Serbia gained full independence to become the kingdom of Serbia. The Rumanians came next, winning autonomy in 1859 and full independence in 1908. Three of these Balkan people&mdash;the Serbs, Greeks and Bulgarians&mdash;came together in 1912 to drive the Turks out of the peninsula. They were successful, and despite a fratricidal war amongst the victors, the Turks were compelled in 1913 to surrender all their remaining territories in the Balkans with the exception of an enclave stretching around the straits from Constantinople to Adrianople.</p>
<p class="indent">The Ottoman Empire’s frontiers shrank gradually from the walls of Vienna in 1683 to the Danube in 1815, to the mid-Balkans in 1878, and to the environs of Constantinople in 1913. Instead the independent Balkan states took its place&mdash;Greece, Serbia, Rumania, Bulgaria and in 1912, Albania.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was The Western Impact on the Turks?</b></i></span> The West affected the Turks much later and much less than it did the Balkan Christians. The most important reason for this was the Turks’ religion (Islam), and their lack of a native middle class. For the Balkan people their faith was a bond with the West, but for the Turks it became a barrier and a formidable one because of the long history of antagonism between Christianity and Islam. The Turks were not affected by the West, also because they had not developed <a id="calibre_link-332" class="calibre10"></a>their own middle class. They had no interest in or respect for commercial pursuits, so that the Ottoman bourgeoisie was largely Greek, American and Jewish. The Turks, in contrast, were either peasants (apathetic to change), teachers and judges in the Muslim ecclesiastical organisation (which meant they were bitterly anti-Western) or they were office holders in the imperial bureaucracy (in which case they had a stake in allowing the status quo to continue). In contrast to the many voices of progress in Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia, the situation in Turkey was a difficult one.</p>
<p class="indent">With no comparable middle class, the few who spoke for reform among the Turks found themselves without a following. However, progress would not be denied and during the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century the Ottoman Empire was penetrated, influenced and controlled by the West in numerous direct and indirect ways. One of the most effective and earliest channels of influence was the military and the Turks found it necessary to adopt European techniques for self-preservation. In the latter half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the westerners actively encouraged the Turks to modernise their military in order to block Russian expansion into the Middle East. It was inevitable that at least some of the young men who went to foreign universities and military academies to study learnt about western ideologies as well as western military techniques. Thus, it was not surprising that when the old Ottoman regime was finally overthrown in 1908, the coup was executed, not by a political party or a mass movement, but by an army clique.</p>
<p class="indent">Where religion was concerned too, the Muslim Middle East was affected by the West. Missionaries began preaching and founding schools throughout the empire. By 1875, American missionaries alone had 240 schools with 8000 pupils. Most of the latter were Armenians and other Christians, but a fair number of Turkish students were to be found in the foreign colleges in the empire. The Turks too had, by this time, established several institutions of higher learning and the Turkish press was also rapidly developing during these years. From only one official and one semi-official weekly in the entire empire in 1859, the press grew to three daily papers and several weeklies by 1882.</p>
<p class="indent">As significant as the cultural compact was the economic intrusion of the West into the Ottoman Empire. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 once again placed the Ottoman Empire on the main trade route between Europe and Asia. The Ottoman Empire was slipping at the same time into the deep debt of European governments and private financiers. The first loan was contracted in 1854 and by 1875 their debts totalled 200 million pounds. Almost 12 million pounds were required to meet annuities, interest, and sinking fund, a sum that amounted to a little more than half the total revenues of the empire. This was too heavy a load, and soon some of the interest payments were defaulted, whereupon in 1881 the Europeans imposed the Ottoman Public Debt Administration. This body consisted mainly of foreign representatives and was entrusted with the revenues from various monopolies and customs duties for the service of the imperial debts.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides this hold over public finances in the Ottoman Empire, the foreign powers had control over the Turkish banking and railway systems, irrigation works, mining enterprises, and municipal public utilities. In addition, the empire was subject to extra-territorial privileges that foreigners enjoyed in the empire since the 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The privileges included exemption from personal imports and customs tariffs. The latter were set at a very low level and could not be raised by the Ottoman government without the consent of the European powers, which normally was not forthcoming. Thus we may conclude that the Ottoman Empire was <a id="calibre_link-333" class="calibre10"></a>in a semi-colonial economic relationship with Europe.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Its Outcome?</b></i></span> It is not possible to precisely measure the effect of all these western pressures and controls but there can be no doubt that they gradually cracked the long impregnable and monolithic Islamic structure. Canals, railways, banks, missionaries, schools and newspapers form that background and also provide the explanation for a literary and intellectual awakening that occurred amongst the Turks in the latter half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="indent">The best known among the leaders of this awakening are Ibrahim Shinassi, Namik Kamal, and Abdul Hamid Ziya. These men did not agree on all issues but they had all lived in Western Europe, been influenced by western thought and literature, as well as by its material achievements. By 1865 a group of young western-minded writers formed around the newspaper “Mushbir”. This paper championed, among other things, the introduction of some form of constitutional government. The imperial regime did not like this and suppressed the paper in 1867. The editor and his colleagues were forced to flee to Paris and London, where they continued their attacks on the imperial regime.</p>
<p class="indent">At this time it was realised by some Turkish statesmen that a comprehensive reform programme along western lines was essential for the survival of the empire. Rashid Pasha (1802&ndash;58) and Midhat Pasha (1822&ndash;84), both of whom served as grand wazirs and issued numerous reform decrees, are the most outstanding. Midhat Pasha took advantage of a domestic financial crisis and a revolution in the Balkans in May 1876, to force Sultan Abdul Aziz to abdicate. He then prepared a constitution providing for an elected parliament, a bill of rights and an independent judiciary. The new Sultan, Abdul Hamid II, was forced to accept the constitution, but had no intention of abiding by it. He dismissed Midhat from Constantinople. The only stirrings of protest were a few placards on walls. Turkish reformers were still faced with mass inertia as a result of which Abdul Hamid was able to rule unchallenged for the remainder of the century.</p>
<p class="indent">Abdul Hamid retained power during those tumultuous decades by relentlessly fighting the disruptive forces of nationalism and constitutionalism. He discouraged travel and study abroad, maintained a vast horde of informers, and censored the press. His agents periodically flushed out groups of disaffected elements who fled to Paris for refuge, from where they published periodicals and pamphlets criticising Hamid’s autocracy. This group became popular in Western Europe as the ‘Young Turk’ group. These exiles were joined by revolutionary leaders of the various subject peoples under Hamid, including Arabs, Greeks, Armenians, Albanians, Kurds and Jews. Representatives of all these nationalities held a congress in Paris in February 1902, with the aim of organising a common front against autocracy. But they soon discovered that their consensus was confined to a dislike of the Sultan. On all other issues there was discord. While one group wanted Turkish predominance, and centralised rule, another favoured decentralisation with power to the subject peoples.</p>
<p class="indent">While the exiled intelligentsia quarrelled, reform-minded Turkish army officers were taking concrete steps to break the Sultan’s hold on the empire. Many had studied abroad or had come in contact with western military missions within the empire and had realised that the Sultan’s policies were outmoded and dangerous. They, therefore, organised the Ottoman Society of Liberty with headquarters in Soloniki. Army officers were key figures in the group though other groups, especially the wealthy and numerous Jews of Saloniki, also helped them. The society was organised into groups of five, so that no one knew more than four members.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-334" class="calibre10"></a>A new member had to be sponsored by a member and was closely watched during probation. This group finally revolted openly in July 1908. They sent an ultimatum to the Sultan, threatening to march upon Constantinople unless the 1876 constitution was restored within 24 hours. On the advice of his state council, Hamid proclaimed the restoration of the constitution. The news was greeted with great rejoicing and Christians and Turks embraced in the streets. But the euphoria did not last long. The issue of centralisation vs decentralisation that divided the Parisian exiles came up and had to be dealt with immediately. Then there was the conservative group which distrusted all Young Turks, the new leaders. Things came to a head and on April 12, 1909, when the conservatives staged a counter-revolution in Constantinople and seized control. However, the Young Turks gathered forces in Macedonia, marched on Constantinople, captured the city and forced Hamid to abdicate. Instead they placed Mohammed V on the throne. The new Sultan by his own admission had not read a newspaper in 10 years. He served as a pliable figurehead for the Young Turks who were now the masters.</p>
<p class="indent">In the few years prior to the World War I they tried to strengthen and modernise their empire, but with little success. They attempted centralisation as well as Turkification and tried to promote loyalty to the Sultan and the Ottoman Empire rather than to the several nationalities within the empire. People resisted this and were passionately opposed to centralisation. The awakening of the Arabs, Albanians, Greeks, Bulgarians and others would not be denied. Once again the cycle of repression and revolt was put in motion.</p>
<p class="indent">The Albanians revolted in 1910. Two years later, the Balkan States united to form a league and turned on the Turks. Meanwhile, Italy attacked the Ottoman province of Tripoli in Africa in 1911. Finding themselves continually at war until 1914, the Young Turks decided to join the Central Powers in the World War I.</p>
<p class="indent">It is apparent, then, that the efforts of the Turks to adjust to the West had proven ineffective. Because of religious and historical traditions, they had shown great resistance to the West, and for that very reason they had also ended up much more vulnerable. They did not develop their own industry, so that their armed forces remained dependent on western arms as well as western instructors. Indeed the Ottoman Empire survived World War I because of the conflicting interests and policies of the Great Powers rather than because of its own strength.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">The Crimean War (1854&ndash;56)</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did It Take Place?</b></i></span> The apparent reason for the outbreak of the Crimean War was the dispute between France and Russia about the Holy Places and the protection of Latin and Orthodox Christians in Turkey, but it soon involved the whole tangled knot of the ‘Eastern Question’. A question of prestige between France and Russia, it also became a clash between Russian efforts to control the Turkish government and British fears of Russian expansion. Inevitably, this aroused Franco-British anxieties to maintain the balance of power by safeguarding Turkish integrity. The original dispute was trivial, in itself no justification for breaking the 40 years’ peace and ruining the Concert of Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">The two years of prolonged manoeuvres which preceded hostilities point out that the powers were not too willing to begin war in 1854. In 1852, the Turkish government, bowing to French pressure, recognised the full claims of the Latin Christians in the Holy Land to take part in the administration of the disputed sanctuaries. Taking cue from this, the Czar of Russia, besides moving troops towards the borders of Turkey, sent in 1853 to Constantinople a special commission, entrusted with the task of getting as clear a treaty right for <a id="calibre_link-335" class="calibre10"></a>Russia to protect the Greek Orthodox Church as France already enjoyed to safeguard the Roman Catholic Church in Ottoman territories. But the Czar’s hope of realising Russian aims without general war was dashed by the course of events. When the Sultan of Turkey, on advice from the British ambassador, made concessions about the Holy Places but firmly refused to recognise a general Russian protectorate over Christians in the Balkans, the Russian Commission left Constantinople and the Russian armies reoccupied Maldavia and Wallachia.</p>
<p class="indent">Even then the powers led by Austria tried to prevent war and called for a conference at Vienna. Their efforts were not successful and in October 1853, Turkey declared war on Russia. When a Russian fleet destroyed a Turkish naval squadron, Britain and France, pressurised by their public, declared war on Russia (March 1854).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did It Take Place?</b></i></span> Soon, Russian forces retreated from Maldavia and Wallachia due to Austrian threat of attack. These provinces were at once taken over by Austria, which held them until they were restored to Turkey at the end of the war. With the removal of the immediate provocation of the war, peace could have been established. But both sides felt too heavily committed to withdraw so soon. National honour was involved, and war continued with a combined attack of Turks, French and British on the Russian naval base of Sebastopol on the southern tip of the Crimean peninsula. But the allied command conducted the seize of Sebastopol in a very clumsy manner and this enabled the Russians to prepare fortifications <a id="calibre_link-336" class="calibre10"></a>that held the attackers at bay for a whole year until September 1855. As the campaign dragged on, the diplomatic scene underwent changes, with Austria and Piedmont joining the allies. When Austria threatened to enter the war, Czar Alexander II (who had succeeded Nicholas I in March 1855) decided to come to terms and because the strain of war was already telling on the peace settlement in February 1856.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00135.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Crimean War</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Its Outcome?</b></i></span> The 1856 settlement was related partly to the immediate conduct between the powers. Turkey’s integrity was recognised and it was agreed that no power had the right to come bet¬ween the Sultan and his Christian subjects. Turkey was admitted to the ‘Public Law and System (Concert) of Europe’, which indicated that for the first time she was brought within the ranks of the Great Powers and accepted as a component in the balance of power. It was also decided that the Black Sea was neutralised with its waters and ports kept open to merchant ships of all nations, but the Straits were closed to foreign warships during peace time.</p>
<p class="indent">Both Turkey and Russia were required to make some concessions in the territorial settlement. Russia gave up a part of the province of Bessarabia, which now became part of Maldavia. The principalities of Maldavia and Wallachia were to continue to enjoy their former privileges and immunities. The Turkish Sultan promised to grant them considerable degree of independence and selfgovernment under supervision of a special commission of the powers. Another Danubian principality, Serbia, was to enjoy similar rights under the collective guarantee of the powers. In these respects, the settlement blocked further steps towards the break-up of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p class="indent">The primary importance of the 1856 settlement lay in its attempts to solve the issues of tension which had caused the first general war in 40 years: the relations between the Turkish government and its subjects and between Russia and Turkey; the question of the Straits and of the Danube; and the breakdown of the Concert of Europe. None of these issues could be solved permanently.</p>
<p class="indent">Turkish power went on diminishing and Turkish promises were often violated. Russian ambitions in the Balkan and the Black Sea did not cease. The Concert of Europe had received a serious blow, and soon other wars followed. The outcome of the Crimean War was as indecisive as its outset had been casual.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Its Place in History?</b></i></span> In long-term perspective, the Crimean War was a strange combination of recurrent and of unusual features in European history. In so far as it was a war between Russia and Turkey, it was but one of the long series of Russo-Turkish Wars, roughly one every generation, beginning from 1760&ndash;74, 1787&ndash;92, 1806&ndash;12, 1828&ndash;29 and going on to 1877&ndash;78. They were the consequence of the constant pressure put on Turkey by Russian desire to extend influence into the Black Sea, the Balkans and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="indent">In so far as it involved a western invasion of Russia, it was likewise one of a long historic sequence that included: the invasions of Napoleon in 1812, of the Germans in 1916&ndash;18, the western allies in 1919&ndash;20, and Hitler in 1941&ndash;44. On the other hand, it was the first war of recent times in which Britain and France fought on the same side, the first in which women, led by Florence Nightingale, took an important part; the first to which the telegraph and press exerted any influence on the course of events.</p>
<p class="indent">This combination of familiar and novel features suggests its intermediate position in the history of modern Europe, just as the indecisiveness of its achievements fixes its significance in diplomatic history. It was fought not so much for Turkey as against Russia. Europe, in the decade after 1848, stood at the parting of the <a id="calibre_link-337" class="calibre10"></a>ways. The old concert was fading away, the balance of power was beginning to shift, and the new era of realism was beginning to see the daylight.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">The Young Turk Movement</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was it?</b></i></span> The Young Turks were Ottoman patriots, staunch supporters of the process of westernisation which Abdul Hamid II had attempted to keep away from his dominions. Many of the younger generation of Turkish noble families were inspired by the western liberal ideas. They had come to believe that successful action against the Sultan lay not in independent acts of terrorism but in the winning over of part of his armed forces to their movement. Their objective was the revival of the abortive liberal constitution of 1876. Their ‘Committee of Union and Progress’ undertook a rigorous propaganda against the Sultan, and by July 1908 won over the ill-paid and disillusioned Third Army Corps stationed at Saloniki. Aided by the Second Army Crops, they declared the constitution revived and marched on Constantinople.</p>
<p class="indent">Faced with so formidable a military revolt, Abdul overnight converted himself into a fulldress constitutional monarch by stopping all censorship of the press and by calling a national parliament on the basis of universal suffrage. The sudden and completeness of his volteface surprised everyone, and amid universal rejoicing the Young Turks seized all offices, and elections were conducted.</p>
<p class="indent">The Young Turks formed a managing committee, under the leadership of Envor Bey, which came to wield all the powers. The new parliament lacked any political experience and became a rubber stamp for Young Turks. Abdul bided his time, mobilising against the new regime all the forces of conservatism and all who were disappointed with the amateurishness and selfishness of the new powers. By April 1909, he was strong enough to lead a counter-revolution, which regained Constantinople and overthrow the new government. But the Young Turks rallied the army once again and recaptured the capital after five hours of fighting. This time they persuaded the parliament to depose Abdul Hamid in favour of his more amenable younger brother, Mohammad V, and Abdul withdraw to a remote place. Mohammad was the ideal figurehead for Young Turkish rule, blending the formalities of legitimist succession with a passive acqueisance in whatever his ministers desired. The extent to which the Young Turks were to disappoint liberal and nationalisthopes, and to prove no less brutal and tyrannical toward subject nationalities than their predecessor soon became clear. But more important were the immediate consequences of their weak-nesses.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was The Outcome?</b></i></span> The annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina formally by Austria (she had hitherto administered them under the terms of the Berlin Treaty) was the first immediate result of the Young Turk Movement. This naturally ignited Serbian nationalist feelings, because there lived one million Serbs in these provinces, and Serbia changed from a friend of Austria into her foe. Though all the powers objected to this violation of the terms of the Berlin Treaty by Austria, the latter ignored them due to German support. At the same time Bulgaria announced her complete independence from Turkey. So, as a result of the whole crisis, Bulgaria emerged more closely tied to Russia, Serbia more violently hostile to Austria and therefore by reaction more likely to look to Russia for future support (because of the Slavic connection).</p>
<p class="indent">The capture of Tripoli (modern Libya) by Italy in 1911 was another important result. Within Italy had grown up a nationalist and colonial party, determined to assert Italy’s claims along side that of France (which had occupied Tunisia in the 1880’s) for colonial possessions in North Africa. When the Italian troops attacked <a id="calibre_link-338" class="calibre10"></a>Libya, the Turkish troops there retreated to the interior and refused to make peace. So the war prolonged and might have gone against Italy, if it was not for the outbreak of another war in the Balkans which forced the Turks to cede Tripoli and make peace. Italy gained little glory from the war, but yet another part of the Ottoman Empire had fallen away.</p>
<p class="indent">One more important consequence of the Young Turk Movement was in the Balkan Wars of 1912&ndash;13. The experience of the inexperienced and tyrannical Young Turkish rule caused Greeks, Serbs, Montenegrins, and Bulgars to unite into the common front of the Balkan League. The war of 1912 was especially the crescendo of Balkan nationalism, forced into a common cause by Turkish intransigence and forced by the complete problems of Macedonia, the hill country lying between Greece, Albania, Serbia and Bulgaria and containing national minorities of all its neighbours.</p>
<p class="indent">In Macedonia the Christians suffered oppression on account of Turkification. They provoked the national sentiments of the fellow Christians in the Balkans, so that Macedonia could become free from the Turkish rule. So the four Balkan states (Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria), after forming a league for joint action against Turkey, attacked her from different sides. In no time they occupied the whole of Turkey, and Constantinople was itself in danger. At this crucial juncture, the Big Powers intervened and peace was signed. According to the Treaty of London (1913), Turkey had to give up all her European territory except that was around Constantinople. Albania became free from Turkey as desired by Austria to see that Serbia became a land-locked country, when the Balkan states began to quarrel over the distribution of spoils. Turkey joined war against Bulgaria with a desire to recover her lost territory. When Bulgaria was defeated and the Treaty of Bucharest was concluded, Turkey got back Adrianople and part of Thrace. Thus, the Balkan Wars of 1912&ndash;13 widened the Christian states by snatching away the Turkish territory in the peninsula. But the Balkan problem continued into the World War I.</p>

<p class="noindent">In 1400, had still seemed sensible to see Jerusalem as the centre of the world. For men pictured a world made up of only three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa) around the shores of one landlocked sea, the Mediterranean. A huge revolution lay just ahead which forever swept away such views and the route to it lay across the oceans, because elsewhere advance was blocked. Europe’s first direct contacts with the East had been mostly on land than on water. Central Asian caravan routes were their primary channel and brought goods west to be shipped from Black Sea or Levant ports. Elsewhere, ships rarely ventured far south of Morocco until the 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Then, a mounting wave of maritime enterprise becomes noticeable and it begins the age of true world history.</p>
<p class="indent">One explanation of it was the growing knowledge of new tools and skills. Better ships and new techniques of long-range navigation were essential for ocean going and they became available from the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century onwards. All these developments facilitated the great effort of exploration which has led to the 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century being called the ‘Age of Renaissance’.</p>
<p class="indent">The Portuguese were bound to be seafarers. Their coastline is dotted with little harbours and river mouths from which, in the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, there emerged swarms of ships to trade. Surrounded by Spain and virtually barred from the Mediterranean trade by the <a id="calibre_link-342" class="calibre10"></a>experienced and powerful Italian merchants, they were forced unwittingly into the Atlantic. This was the starting of the “Age of Discovery”, and its heart was systematic, government-spon-sored research. The Portuguese pushed steadily south. In 1473, they sailed over the Equator and in 1487 reached the Cape of Good Hope. Ahead lay the Indian Ocean, which now became a geographical reality to Europeans. Finally, in 1498, Vasco da Gama dropped anchor at Calicut on the west coast of India.</p>
<p class="indent">By that time, another sailor, Columbus, had crossed the Atlantic in search of Asia. He instead discovered the Americas for the Spanish Crown in 1492. Soon, though Columbus to his dying day refused to admit it, it began to be realised that this was not Asia after all. In 1494, the term ‘New World’ came to be used for the first time to his discoveries. In 1522, 30 years after Columbus’s great discoveries, a ship in Spanish service but commanded by a Portuguese, Magellan, completed the first voyage round the world. With this voyage and its demonstration that all the great oceans were interconnected, the prologue to the European age can be considered over.</p>
<p class="indent">A mere hundred years of discovery and exploration had drastically altered the shape of the world and the course of history. From now onwards the countries with access to the Atlantic would fare much better than the land-locked powers of Central Europe and the Mediterranean. In the first place this meant Spain and Portugal, but they would be joined and surpassed by France, Holland and above all, England. These Western European countries had a number of harbours incomparably placed at the centre of the newly enlarged hemisphere, all of them easily accessible from their shallow hinterland, and within easy reach of all the great European sea routes of the next 200 years.</p>
<p class="indent">The astonishing aspect of this development is its cumulative and systematic nature. European expansion in the next phase of world history would be conscious and directed as it had never been before. Europeans had always desired land and gold: the greed that goaded enterprise was not new. Nor was the religious zeal which occasionally motivated them and sometimes cloaked their springs of action even from the actors themselves. What was new was an increasing confidence emanating from knowledge and success. In 1500 Europeans were on the threshold of an age in which their energy and confidence would grow ostensibly without limit. The world did not come to them; they went out to it and took it. Soon, discovery would be followed by conquest. A world revolution was beginning. An equilibrium which had lasted a thousand years was dissolving and its disappearance was to be made manifest in the next two centuries.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What Were Geographical Discoveries?</b></i></span> The period from the middle of the 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century to the beginning of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century is known as the ‘Age of Discovery’. For during this period many voyages of exploration were undertaken and many new sea routes, new lands and continents were discovered. The people who undertook these voyages of exploration were led by the same renaissance spirit of curiosity that had already led to new developments in literature, science, government and religion. The main motivation behind these voyages was the profits that (demonstrated by Vasco da Gama’s first voyage to India) made governments and financiers to undertake the organisation of voyages on a scale that was unimaginable before. The Mediterranean Sea was the limit of the known world to the people living in the Ancient and Medieval Europe, but gradually the more venturesome extended their activities beyond the bounds of that great inland-sea to the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, civilisation passed from an inland-sea stage to an oceanic stage, and sailors turned their ships both towards the Americas and the Far East.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What Were the Motives Behind Them?</b></i></span> The single most important factor was the prospects <a id="calibre_link-343" class="calibre10"></a>of new and more lucrative trade. Until the 11<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, trade except that which was confined to the Western Mediterranean, was monopolised by the Muslims. Italian traders gradually made in-roads until they gained possession of some of the profitable commerce with the cities of Egypt and Syria. The Muslims, continuing to bring products from the Orient, sold them to Italian merchants. The prosperity of the Italian cities that had grown rich from this trade aroused the envy of other European countries, and they longed to have a share in this profitable trade, especially in spices. The writings of Marco Polo made Europeans aware of the East and its riches. Further stories about new lands found their way into Western Europe; and this led some venturesome sailors to make plans for finding it.</p>
<p class="indent">Europeans were in need of more produce to support a growing population. There was a shortage of spices (which were essential for the Europeans to preserve their food before the technological revolution), drugs, cottons, gold, silver and precious stones. Commerce from the Far East came to Europe through three major routes &mdash; the Southern route following the Red Sea and proceeding overland to the Nile and Northern Egypt; the middle route passing through the Persian Gulf and up the Euphrates river to Syria and the Black Sea Coast: and the northern one across Central Asia to the Caspian and Black Seas. The expense and hazards of these routes, combined with the difficulties after the capture of Constantinople (Capital of the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire) by the Turks in 1453, compelled the Europeans to look for an all-water route to the East.</p>
<p class="indent">The European Renaissance, which marked the end of the Medieval Age and the beginning of the Modern Age in Europe, led the Europeans not only to effect new developments in literature, science, government and religion, but also to adventure and discovery of new lands and routes. The people in Medieval Europe were conservative, narrow-minded and superstitious mainly due to the then prevailing socioeconomic and political system, viz., the feudal system. Due to renaissance, there was a desire among the people to broaden their mental outlook. As a result, many people became enthusiastic and enterprising, and undertook difficult sea voyages to discover new lands and new routes.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a significant growth of geographical knowledge in the 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries as is evidenced from the large number of books on travel that were written during this period. ‘<i class="calibre8">A Merchant’s Handbook</i>’, written by a Florentine (Italian), described all the known trade routes between Western Europe and the Far East. ‘<i class="calibre8">Secrets of the Faithful Crusader</i>’, written by a Venetian (also an Italian), told about Asiatic cities. Other books on travel, including the ‘<i class="calibre8">Far East</i>’, the ‘<i class="calibre8">Holy Lands</i>’, and ‘<i class="calibre8">Africa</i>’, found their way into the homes of many European, long before Columbus started his voyage that resulted in the discovery of America. Amerigo Vespucci, who was also an Italian and who further explored the areas discovered by Columbus, wrote an account of his voyages that stimulated interest in the Americas. The Medieval theory that the earth was flat was gradually discarded and books that depicted the earth as a sphere began to appear. This belief that the earth is round and that one can arrive in the East by sailing westward further stimulated explorations.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain scientific developments too occurred during this period; facilitating the voyages of exploration and discovery. Before the end of the 13<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the mariner’s compass (which was a Chinese invention) was introduced into Europe, and men were no longer left to the mercy of a fine night and the stars to determine the direction in which they were sailing. The sailors could now undertake long voyages far from the sight of land. There was an improvement in ship-building too, which made ships more sea-worthy. Map-making became more accurate which was useful for the sailors. All these scientific developments made possible voyages that would have been out of the question in earlier times.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-345" class="calibre10"></a>The demands of religion, i.e., the desire to spread Christianity also gave an impetus to geographical discoveries. While the merchants and traders were searching for an all-water route to the East, the Christian priests and monks were eager to carry the Christian religion to foreign and un-chartered lands. As a result, merchants and missionaries quite often travelled together to the remotest parts of the world.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">When and How Were They Made?</b></i></span> One main land-water route to the Far East remained after Constantinople was closed. This route from Western Europe led across the Mediterranean Sea to Alexandria in Egypt. From there, goods were carried by Arab Caravans around Turkey and into the Far Eastern trading lands. But it was a dangerous journey. Traders faced the loss of their goods and their lives to bandit gangs. The Italians, located in the centre of the Mediterranean, made good use of the Egyptian route. Portugal, Spain, England, France and Holland wanted to end Italy’s hold on the trade routes and find an all-water route to the Far East. Students of navigation set out to solve this problem.</p>
<p class="indent">Prince Henry, the Navigator (1394&ndash;1460), the son of a Portuguese king, built a school for seamen on the coast of Portugal where many young men learned the secrets of the sea. Henry talked with travellers who had visited distant lands. He invented or helped improve navigational instruments such as the astrolabe, quadrant and compass. These instruments were used to determine directions and distances by reading the stars and pointing out directions on maps and charts. Using the lessons learned from Prince Henry, Portuguese sea-captains made their nation the leader of sea trade. Prince Henry told fearful captains that there were no sea monsters. “Go forth”, Henry told his captains, “Explore, trade”.</p>
<p class="indent">Some daring sea-captains believed that an all-water route to India could be found around the southern tip of Africa. Many sailed down Africa’s west coast but turned back because of heavy storms off Africa’s northwestern hump. India did not lie straight ahead, as they expected, but the course turned east still along the African coast. First to reach and round the cape at Africa’s tip was Bartholomew Diaz, a Portuguese captain, in 1487. He rode out the coastal storms and continued his journey when the course swung south again. Finally, he viewed open water stretching far to the east. Diaz had reached Africa’s tip. He wanted to call it the Cape of Storms, but Portugal’s King John II said, “We will call it the Cape of Good Hope”, as it is named today. Only a threatened mutiny by his crew kept Diaz from sailing around the cape into the Indian Ocean where India and the east lay ahead.</p>
<p class="indent">Christopher Columbus believed that the world was round and that by sailing west he could reach India and the Far East. He thought the distance was shorter than it really was. He also had no idea that vast, unknown continents lay between Europe and India. After studying the lessons of Prince Henry, the Navigator, he sought monetary backing for a westward voyage. Finally, Columbus won the support of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. They provided $ 30,000 to outfit three small ships; the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria. On 3 August 1492, Columbus sailed from Palos, Spain, and headed southwest.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-346" class="calibre10"></a>Columbus stopped for a month in the Canary Islands for supplies and repairs, then headed west. Five weeks passed, and Columbus’s crew of 88 sailors, fearful and restless, threatened mutiny and even considered throwing “that crazy captain” overboard. Then birds were seen and tree branches floated by &mdash; sure signs of land. Shortly, a small flat island with palms and tropical plants was sighted. Columbus went ashore and claimed the island in the name of Spain. He named the island San Salvador (Holy Saviour). Today it is believed to be Watling Island, in the present Bahamas. But Columbus thought he had reached islands off India, calling them the Indies and the natives Indians. Columbus sailed on and reached Cuba and Hispaniolas (today’s Dominican Republic and Haiti).</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to Spain, Columbus was hailed as a hero. He made three more voyages to the West between 1493 and 1504, sailing along the coast of South America, and made one short stop in Central America. After Queen Isabella’s death, Columbus could not find backers for further explorations. Living in poverty, a lonely, forgotten man, Columbus died in 1506, still believing he had reached off-shore lands of India. Although he never knew that the land he had reached was a New World, other people studying the voyages began to think so.</p>
<p class="indent">His voyage was a breakthrough to new lands holding much promise. Rulers of powerful European nations sent explorers to new lands to seek riches and claim territory. At first one of the main goals of the explorers was to find a northwest passage through the new lands to provide a trade route to the Far East.</p>
<p class="indent">To settle claims between Portugal and Spain, Pope Alexander VI in 1493 declared a Line of Demarcation, or dividing line, through the Atlantic Ocean. The line ran from North to South, about 250 miles west of the Azores islands (the line later moved 1,000 miles farther west). The Pope ruled that Spain had rights to lands discovered west of the line and Portugal owned those discovered to the east. France, England and the Netherlands did not observe the Demarcation Line.</p>
<p class="indent">Beginning in 1497, another Italian, Amerigo Vespucci, made four trips to the South American coast. He wrote an account of its geography and the natives. A German geographer later named the land America, after the Latin version of Vespucci’s first name, Amerigo. Later John Cabot, an Italian sailing for England in two voyages (1497&ndash;1498), sailed along the coasts of Labrador and Newfoundland. He landed on the present Cape Breton Island off Nova Scotia. Cartier, sailing for France in search of a northwest passage, explored the St. Lawrence River to the present sites of Montreal and Quebec in Canada.</p>
<p class="indent">Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese captain, was the first to make an all-sea voyage from Europe to India. From 1497&ndash;1498, da Gama sailed around the Cape of Good Hope at the tip of Africa and continued to reach Calicut on the Malabar Coast of India. Da Gama gained great wealth from trading in India. In 1500, another Portuguese captain, named Pedro Alvarez Cabral, set out to sail for India. Strong winds blew him so far west that Cabral ended up on the coast of present Brazil in South America. Portugal’s claim to the country was recognised by other nations.</p>
<p class="indent">Vasco Nunez de Balboa in 1513 was the leader of a group of Europeans and Africans who became the first men to see the Pacific Ocean from the American side. The expedition crossed the Isthmus of Panama from the Atlantic side to reach the Pacific. From 1532&ndash;1536, Francisco Pizarro invaded the Inca Empire in Peru, South America. Pizarro also seized gold and silver worth millions and shipped them back to Spain.</p>
<p class="indent">King Francis I of France in 1524 sent Giovanni da Verrazano, an Italian, to find a northwest passage to Asia. Instead, Verrazano <a id="calibre_link-347" class="calibre10"></a>found present New York Bay and Manhattan Island. In 1609, Henry Hudson, an Englishman, was sent by Holland on a search for a northwest passage. Hudson sailed his ship, the Half Moon, into New York Bay and up the wide river now named after him, the Hudson.</p>
<p class="indent">Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese captain, led a Spanish expedition which, from 1519 to 1522, sailed around the world. The voyage followed the western route, from Spain across the Atlantic, around South America and across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, around Africa, and back to Spain. Magellan was killed in a fight with natives in Philippine Islands.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Outcome?</b></i></span> The people who undertook the voyages of discovery were the true pioneers who staked their lives. The risks they took were even greater than those of today’s astronauts. Though their primary object behind all those life-risking was profit, their discoveries changed man’s idea of the world, revolutionised trade, and started a wave of colonising that has determined the course of world history ever since, besides facilitating the transformation of the feudal society into a modern one.</p>
<p class="indent">The geographical discoveries led to a massive revival of trade and commerce, both internal and external, in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, which has been generally termed as the ‘Commercial Revolution’. With the discovery of the ‘New World’ (the Americas), there began an unprecedented inflow of huge quantities of bullion (gold and silver) from the New World to Europe. And with the discovery of new sea routes to the east, spices from the east began to flood the European market. In the initial years, i.e., before the Industrial Revolution in Europe, the Europeans bought Eastern goods with the bullion that they had acquired from the Americas. The above developments led to the introduction of new crops and goods in Europe from the Americas (such as tobacco, maize, quinine, potato, tomato, etc.,) and from the east (such as spices, sugarcane, tea, coffee, silk, opium, cotton, etc.). Thus, commercial relations were established on a large scale between Europe on the one hand, and the Americas and the East on the other.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00098.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-348" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00124.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">They also paved the way for the beginning of capitalism in Europe. Besides the existing industries, several new industries that were connected with the processing of the new goods (tobacco, tea, sugarcane, cotton, etc.) began to spring up. All the ingredients that the new as well as the old industries required were acquired from the New World and the east in a variety of ways: by military plunder; forced unequal trade with primitive tribesmen; and imposition of taxes, tributes and trade restrictions on both natives and colonies overseas. Further, the Commercial Revolution that began with the geographical discoveries also helped to accelerate capitalism by evolving the modern currency system, joint-stock companies, banking system and financial markets.</p>
<p class="indent">The transformation of the European socio-political set-up from a feudal one into a modern one was another important result. Progress in trade and commerce gave rise to the middle classes that became wealthy and prosperous. As such their influence in society and politics increased tremendously and they got many privileges. They became the backbone of the European society, and began to dominate the social order. The success of the middle classes in acquiring political power and social prestige, in alliance with the kings led to the gradual decline of the feudal lords and the assertion of absolute powers by the kings.</p>
<p class="indent">They also started a wave of colonisation and exploitation that has determined the course of world history ever since. Wherever the explorers went, the flag of their nation soon followed. The first conquerors were Spain <a id="calibre_link-349" class="calibre10"></a>and Portugal. However, soon the English, the French and the Dutch followed suit, and set up colonies in Asia, Africa and the Americas. They brought the natives of these lands under their sway, and exploited them politically as well as economically. One more tragic part of the colonisation was the trade in human beings. The people of the newly discovered areas in Africa were enslaved and transported to the newly discovered areas in the Americas. The slave trade brought immense profits to the slave traders. Though this new system of exploitation was first practiced by only the Spaniards and the Portuguese, it was later adopted by all the other Europeans.</p>
<p class="indent">The geographical discoveries also led to the propagation and spread of Christianity to new lands and people. The explorers were followed not only by the flag of their nation but also its missionaries. Many explorers even sincerely believed that their main aim was to carry the “word of God and knowledge of His son to the far corners of the globe”. Thus the geographical discoveries provided the Christian missionaries new fields for the propagation of their faith, and they achieved quite a bit of success in this, of course, with the direct (e.g., Portuguese) or the indirect (e.g., British) support of their government.</p>
<p class="indent">There are certain other results of the geographical discoveries. As a result of the discovery of the Americas and Africa, the Atlantic Ocean became the main highway of international trade, and European towns on the Atlantic, such as Lisbon, London, Amsterdam, etc., increased in their importance. As a result of the increase in European trade and industry, there was a remarkable improvement in the standards of living of the Europeans, of course, at the cost of the people of Asia, Africa and the Americas. Finally, as a result of these discoveries, there began a fierce competition for colonial possessions and wealth among the Europeans. That is why, we find a number of commercial wars breaking out between England and Spain, between Spain and France, and between Holland and Portugal.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-44"><b class="calibre9">MEANING, NATURE AND STAGES OF COLONIALISM</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">During the age of royal absolutism, the European nations intensified their competition for overseas possessions and commerce. They were spurred on in large part by the riches that flowed to Europe from these possessions but also by a conviction that overseas possessions enhanced the power of nations. Whereas Spain and Portugal had led the way beyond the Atlantic frontier during the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, England, France, and the Netherlands threw themselves vigorously into colonising and commercial expansion in various quarters of the globe during the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries. The newcomers indeed outstripped their older rivals and established themselves as the leading European colonial powers. As large as the world beyond Western Europe was, the competition for it led to struggles among the leading European powers; the outcome of these struggles decisively affected the power relationships among the competing nations. And while the Europeans colonised, traded, and competed around the globe, European civilisation spread with them, impacting with varying results on the native populations encountered by the Europeans. The 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries marked a decisive turning point <a id="calibre_link-351" class="calibre10"></a>in the establishment of Western European domination over much of the world. No less significantly, European expansion laid the basis for a global economy.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Colonialism and Imperialism?</b></i></span> No simple definition can convey aptly the meaning of the term ‘Colonialism’, for its usage has tended to reflect changing moral judgments. During the early modern period, the term was applied only to colonies of white settlers and was used in either of the two morally neutral ways, viz., a feature distinct of such colonies or the political status of a dependency as different from the metropolis (i.e., parent state). Its 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century usage in the sense of a colonial system resulted from its adoption as part of the verb ammunition of the age of decolonisation. In this it suffered the fate of ‘Imperialism’, which after 1900, was adopted by critics of European expansion to serve ideological purposes and used incorrectly to suggest both the annexation of territories and their subsequent state of subordination. By the mid-20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, colonialism also began to be used in this derogatory sense. Both terms were gradually refined and distinguished.</p>
<p class="indent">While “Imperialism” came to denote the driving force of European empire-building and, for Marxists, the special nature of capitalist societies that acquires empires, “Colonialism” described the resultant complex of political and economic controls imposed on dependencies. Colonialism, therefore, must now be taken to mean the colonial system in its post-expansionist phase, which implies that it constituted a system of controls that was built by the imperial powers to subordinate and to exploit their dependencies. The term ‘Imperialism’ refers to the outward thrust of European society, i.e., the carrying of European political, economic and moral practices into non-European areas, from the 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century onwards. Though the two terms are often used as synonyms because of their close relationship, they nonetheless should be distinguished for proper understanding.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What Were the Causes for European Rivalry?</b></i></span> In spite of the vast lands to occupy in the New World and rich trading opportunities to exploit in the highly civilised east and in sub-Saharan Africa, the aggressive European nations could not keep out of one another’s way in their overseas expansion. As a consequence, the rivalry of European nations became global. The outcome of these struggles began to determine the destinies of peoples only remotely involved in the competition of the European states.</p>
<p class="indent">The competition for empire was rooted in two interrelated factors: the essential importance of overseas trade to the expanding economies of the major European nations and the policy of mercantilism practiced by most European powers.</p>
<p class="indent">The growing importance of overseas commerce to national economies was abundantly clear. New products from abroad &ndash; among others, spices, sugar, tobacco, cotton, silk, tea &ndash; were in high demand. So were some manufactured goods from the Far East, especially cotton textiles and chinaware. Colonists needed the products of European manufacturers. The opportunities to transport these goods stimulated shipbuilding. The need to distribute products from abroad created new opportunities for merchants. The funding of overseas trading and colonising ventures stimulated the development of banking and credit. The profits garnered from overseas trading activities not only improved the standard of living of those who earned the profits but also became a prime source of capital for investment in agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce. Even governments relied on the gains from overseas trade to provide taxes and loans. In short, Europe’s economy had become the focal point for a global system. Control of that economy was vital to the well-being of <a id="calibre_link-352" class="calibre10"></a>European nations, even to the point of fighting others for a share of the lucrative overseas trade.</p>
<p class="indent">The realities of 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-and 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century economic life found expression in the widely accepted economic policy of mercantilism, which accentuated the importance of competition, for overseas trade and colonies. Mercantilist policy was based on the conviction that the economic well-being of a nation depended on directing the total national economy in a way that would produce a favourable balance of bullion coming into the economy. Among other things, this policy saw colonies as a source of cheap food and raw materials and an outlet for manufactured goods that would return a profit to the mother country. Such a view made the accession and the careful management of the colonies crucial to each nation that aspired to be powerful. Especially important was the need to monopolise trade with a nation’s colonies, which placed a premium on developing naval power. Likewise, mercantilism dictated that every effort be made to restrict the colonising ventures of rival nations and to deprive them of their colonial possessions whenever possible. Thus, every conflict among the major European nations in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries was extended to their colonies, and every major peace settlement included a redistribution of overseas possessions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was the Course and Nature of Competition?</b></i></span> The competition for the fruits of overseas empires began in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century with the English and Dutch assaults on Spanish and Portuguese trading activities and overseas holdings. By the middle of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, competition began to intensify and to become more general. More than any other country, England allied governmental economic policy with private commercial interests, with a view toward promoting national well-being. This approach cast England into a particularly aggressive role in the competition for empire and trade. As early as 1651, England passed its first Navigation Act, providing that all goods coming to and from England and its overseas possessions must be carried in English ships.</p>
<p class="indent">This policy posed a challenge to Dutch commercial power, which was especially successful in providing shipping services to other nations. It also encouraged the growth of the English merchant fleet and the navy, badly neglected during the early Stuart period. On three different occasions between 1651 and 1688, England engaged the Dutch in warfare. As a result, Dutch commercial ascendancy began to be undermined while England’s commercial power grew; the Dutch also lost their North American colonies.</p>
<p class="indent">Toward the end of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the English and the Dutch began to see that France was the chief threat to both. The result was an Anglo-Dutch alliance made by William of Orange when he became king of England in 1689. By that time the Netherlands was no longer the major sea power in Europe. The Dutch were increasingly content to keep their already established holdings in the East Indies, to continue their declining but still profitable carrying trade, and to reap a great profit as the chief bankers and money lenders of Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">From 1689 until 1763, England and France fought each other regularly in Europe, and each engagement had its repercussions abroad. Several times during the War of the League of Augsburg (1688&ndash;1697), the English and the French forces engaged in North America, where the war was called King William’s War. Neither in Europe nor in America was the action decisive, and no changes were made in the holdings of either combatant. England had more success during the War of the Spanish Succession (1702&ndash;13). In North America, where the struggle was called Queen Anne’s War, England captured Acadia (Nova Scotia) and received recognition of its claims to Newfoundland and Hudson Bay. From France’s ally, Spain, England received Gibraltar and Minorca, assuring entrance into the Mediterranean. Spain also granted to England the right to supply Spain’s colonies with slaves (the <i class="calibre8">asiento)</i> and the privilege of sending one ship a year to the Spanish colonies in America. These concessions ended Spain’s long effort to close its empire to outsiders and gave England the advantage over other nations in exploiting trading opportunities provided by the Spanish overseas holdings.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-353" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00065.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">From 1713 to 1740 England and France remained at peace. During this calm neither nation was idle in overseas matters. France, realising the weakness of its position, was especially active in North America. France tried to protect its holdings from English sea power by building a strong fort at Louisburg at the mouth of the St. Lawrence. France also began constructing and garrisoning a series of forts in its territories west of the Appalachians designed to keep the English colonists pinned to the Atlantic seaboard. England concentrated its efforts on widening the commercial breach it had made in Spain’s empire in 1713. A new European war in 1740, the War of the Austrian Succession, led to a sharp conflict between England and France in America (King George’s War) and in India. At the end of the war in 1748, each power restored its spoils to the other, England giving up Louisburg and France restoring Madras.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-354" class="calibre10"></a>An eight-year truce ensued in Europe, each side preparing desperately for the struggle that everyone knew would soon reopen. In North America, France went back to the policy of building a barrier against the westward expansion of the English colonies. The inevitable clash came in 1755, when the British unsuccessfully tried to stop the French from occupying Fort Duquesne, at the present site of Pittsburgh. The issue was clearly joined; one power must destroy the other in America.</p>
<p class="indent">In India a no less dramatic struggle was shaping. France had entered the scene later than England but had made steady progress up to 1740. Between 1740 and 1756 the French and British manipulated the internal chaos in India. Thus, at the opening of the Seven Years’ War (French and Indian War in America) in 1756, France and England were pitted against each other on three continents. In that war England, led by William Pitt, threw its chief efforts into the naval and colonial war and won a smashing victory. In North America, the French forces held their own until 1757. After that the superior British forces, supported by the navy, overpowered the French outposts one by one. The decisive blow came in 1759, when the British captured Quebec, opening all Canada to the British. British naval units captured the chief French holdings in the West Indies. In India, Robert Clive gave the British a decisive victory at the battle of Plassey in 1757.</p>
<p class="indent">The Seven Years’ War ended in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris. France surrendered Canada and all Louisiana east of the Mississippi (except New Orleans) to England. Spain, which had been an ally of France, ceded Florida to England. By a special treaty, France compensated Spain for this loss by giving Spain the rest of Louisiana (west of the Mississippi). All French possessions in the West Indies except Guadeloupe and Martinique also fell to England. France’s empire in India likewise went to Britain. The French were permitted to enjoy trading privileges in India and to keep Pondicherry, but Britain controlled the chief centres of trade, ending any hope of a French recovery of power there. The Treaty of Paris closed an era in European expansion. Although the Dutch and the Spanish still had extensive holdings abroad, Great Britain had fought its way to supremacy in colonial and commercial affairs. The English could now turn to the exploitation of that empire.</p>
<p class="indent">Since Columbus’ voyage, the Europeans had wrought an important change around the world. Energetic colonisers had planted European civilisation on the soil of the New World. Enterprising merchants had begun to tap the wealth of a considerable part of the Far East and of sub-Saharan Africa, creating for the first time a global economy in which the level of prosperity in European nations was directly related to their access to the labour and products of peoples all over the earth. European patterns of civilisation had begun to alter the lives of peoples who had developed their own cultures long before the Europeans came. For good or bad, the Europeanisation of the world had begun. European history never again ceased to have a world-wide scope.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How Did the Europeans Exploit the New World?</b></i></span> One of the areas attracting the English, French, and Dutch was the New World, where all three nations established thriving colonies during the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and eventually became embroiled in bitter rivalry for dominance. The northern European nations had their appetites whetted by the fabulous profits reaped from the New World by the Spanish and the Portuguese during the sixteenth century. These two powers retained their vast empires in Central and South America during the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries and continued to earn a rich reward from their enterprises. During the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century the hauls of gold and silver declined, and the Spanish and Portuguese turned their energies toward <a id="calibre_link-355" class="calibre10"></a>creating large plantations worked by oppressed natives and imported African slaves to produce products marketable in Western Europe. Their presence in South and Central America forced the attention of the English, French, and Dutch toward North America and the Caribbean area.</p>
<p class="indent">The English were the most successful colonisers in North America. Although some settlers were prompted by political and religious reasons, most were lured by the prospects of available land. Colonising ventures were organised by joint stock companies chartered by the government to plant settlements in the New World or by individual leaders granted huge tracts of land for the purpose of colonisation. Between 1607, when the first colony was planted at Jamestown, Virginia, and 1733, when a colony was founded in Georgia, England established control of the Atlantic seaboard from Maine to the Spanish colony in Florida. In the 13 colonies, a stable order soon emerged that showed considerable potential for agricultural and commercial growth. This growth was promoted by a steady flow of emigrants, not only from England but also from other northern European nations. By the beginning of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the English settlers were beginning to push westward out of the coastal colonies in search of new lands to occupy. English explorers and traders penetrated into the Hudson Bay area in Canada and claimed for England a huge territory, where soon a profitable trade in fur developed. Flourishing English colonies were established in the West Indies, the chief ones being Barbados, Jamaica, and Bermuda. In this area, the English concentrated on developing highly profitable sugar plantations, utilising African slaves as a labour supply.</p>
<p class="indent">France also undertook to colonise in the New World, although not as successfully as England. Its first American colony was established by Samuel de Champlain at Quebec on the St. Lawrence River in 1608. Champlain later explored and claimed for France the entire St. Lawrence Valley from the Atlantic to the Great Lakes. Toward the end of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century during the reign of Louis XIV, the French extended their holdings in North America by claiming a huge territory called Louisiana, stretching down the Mississippi Basin from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. The French also established prosperous colonies in the West Indies, especially on Martinique and Guadeloupe, where sugar production was the major economic activity.</p>
<p class="indent">Except for the West Indies, settlers were slow to come to France’s vast, rich lands in the New World, in part because of governmental policy. France closed its empire to non-Catholics, thus excluding an element so important in populating England’s colonies &ndash; the religiously dissatisfied. By adopting a policy of land allocation that favoured the aristocracy, the French government made it difficult for commoners to obtain land overseas. The opportunities for profits offered by the fur trade discouraged agricultural settlement. When England seized France’s American empire in 1763, perhaps no more than eighty thousand settlers lived in New France, compared with the 1.5 million inhabitants of the English colonies. But that sparse population left its marks, especially in the form of Roman Catholicism, the French language, and the imitation of French social practices by settlers in the St. Lawrence Valley and Southern Louisiana &ndash; marks that persist to the present to give a distinctive character to society in these areas.</p>
<p class="indent">The Dutch also became involved in the colonising of North America. In 1621 the Dutch West India Company was chartered to undertake colonising and commerce in the New World. In 1624, a Dutch colony was planted on Manhattan Island, a location made especially attractive because of its potential as a centre from which trade could be controlled. Soon other Dutch communities were established in <a id="calibre_link-356" class="calibre10"></a>the valleys of the Hudson, Connecticut, and Delaware rivers. However, the Dutch did not push their colonising effort very seriously. Their interest was chiefly in trading activities, leading them to concentrate their energies on the more profitable East Indies. Their American colonies became a bone of contention in the Anglo-Dutch struggles that preceded the Glorious Revolution in England. In 1664 the English seized New Netherlands, ending Dutch colonisation in North America.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade?</b></i></span> During the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, Western Europeans made significant crossroads into sub-Saharan Africa. Again the Portuguese had been the early leaders, but they were eventually joined by others. It was the establishment of the plantation system in the New World that sparked a new interest of Europeans in Africa. The plantations needed labour; African slaves could provide that commodity. Portuguese, Dutch, English, French, and North American traders and adventurers, acting with the support of their governments, established a series of trading posts along the West African coast stretching from modern Senegal to Angola chiefly for the purpose of purchasing slaves to be transported to the New World.</p>
<p class="indent">For centuries the most valuable of African resources for Europeans were the slaves, but these could be obtained at coastal ports, without any need for penetration inland. Although the slave stations were restricted <a id="calibre_link-357" class="calibre10"></a>to the coast, the slave trade nevertheless had profound repercussions upon considerable areas of sub-Saharan Africa. The trade began in 1442 when two captains of Prince Henry the Navigator took 12 African slaves to Lisbon. It is true that slavery already was an established and widespread institution in Africa. Prisoners of war were enslaved, as were also debtors or individuals guilty of serious crimes. These slaves usually were treated as part of the family; they had clearly defined rights, and their status was not necessarily hereditary. In Europe, by contrast, slavery was a very different institution and had a very different history. From the beginning it was primarily an economic expedient, so that slaves were worked to death in mines during classical times. This impersonalism was reinforced by racism when the Europeans became involved in the African slave trade on a large scale. Perhaps as a subconscious rationalisation they gradually came to look down upon Negroes as inherently inferior, and therefore preordained to serve their white masters. Rationalisation also may have been involved in the Europeans’ use of religion to justify the traffic in human beings. Enslavement, it was argued, assured the conversion of the African heathen to the true faith as well as to civilisation.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00092.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">In this self-satisfied spirit, the Portuguese shipped thousands of African slaves to their homeland. This was but a petty prelude to the new and fateful phase of the slave trade that began in 1510 when the first shipload of African slaves was shipped to the New World. The venture was highly successful, for there was urgent need for labour in the Americas, especially on the sugar plantations. The market for slaves was almost limitless, and several other countries entered the slave trade to share in the rich profits. Portugal dominated the trade in the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, Holland during most of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>, and Britain in the 18th. The West African coast was dotted with about 40 European forts which were used for defence against the rival trading nations and for storing the slaves while awaiting shipment across the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00119.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-358" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00048.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was its Nature and Course?</b></i></span> The typical voyage of the slave traders was triangular. The first leg was from the homeport to Africa, with a cargo including salt, cloth, firearms, hardware, beads, and rum. These goods were bartered for slaves brought by fellow-Africans from the interior to the coast. The unfortunate victims were packed under atrocious conditions in the vessels and shipped across the Atlantic on the so-called ‘middle passage’. At their New World destinations, the slaves were either sold at once or held in stockades to be retailed on demand. The final lap was the voyage home with plantation produce such as sugar, molasses, tobacco, or rice.</p>
<p class="indent">Thanks to the prevailing trade winds the ‘middle passage’ was normally swift and brief. Nevertheless, the average death rate during the trip ranged from 10 to 55 percent, depending on the length of the voyage, the chance occurrence of epidemics, and the treatment accorded the slaves. This treatment almost invariably involved inhuman crowding, stifling heat, and poor food. Even greater casualties were suffered earlier, during the overland march to <a id="calibre_link-359" class="calibre10"></a>the coast. Raiding parties plundered villages and broke up families in their search for strong young men and women. The captives were then driven from dawn to dusk in the blazing heat and pouring rain, through thick jungles or over dry plains. The survivors who reached the coast were driven naked into the market like cattle. Then they were branded with the name of the company or buyer and herded into the forts to await shipment across the ocean. It is not surprising that, in supplying American plantations with some 12 million slaves, Africa suffered an estimated loss in casualties of about four times the number of people.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was it Abolished?</b></i></span> Despite these horrors, Europeans continued to buy and sell Africans for over four centuries. The profits were so high that powerful vested interests strongly opposed any proposals for control or abolition. There were first of all the African chiefs who received as much as £20 to £36 for a single able-bodied slave. These African leaders played a vital role in the slave-trade operations. Their participation was essential for the Europeans who were confined to the coastal areas and who suffered mortality rates of 25 to 50 percent. Not only did the African middlemen reap handsome profits from the trade but they also were violently opposed to all abolition proposals. Indeed, riots against Europeans were organised on African soil in defiance of the abolition movement!</p>
<p class="indent">The plantation owners in the Americas likewise supported the slave trade, especially the Barbados planters who held an important bloc of seats in the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century British Parliament. There were European vested interests also that championed the slave trade, both amongst the traders and the various merchants at home who provided rum and manufactured goods. According to one estimate, Britain shipped to Africa manufactures valued at 1 million pounds a year, and the other European countries sent an equal amount for the same purpose. The return on this outlay was so extraordinarily high that in the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century the prosperity of cities such as Liverpool and Bristol depended heavily on this traffic.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite these formidable obstacles, a small group of reformers campaigned vigorously for abolition. In 1787, they established in England the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. In 1823, they founded the Anti-Slavery Society to end the institution of slavery as well as the slave trade. These abolitionists were aided by the progress of the industrial revolution, which was rendering slavery obsolete. Advancing technology called for overseas markets rather than for cheap supply of human power. In fact, the abolitionists argued that the slave trade was inefficient and insisted that a more profitable ‘legitimate’ trade could be developed in Africa.</p>
<p class="indent">The first success of the abolitionists was a law in 1807 prohibiting British ships from participating in the slave trade and banning the landing of slaves in British colonies. Finally, in 1833 Parliament passed a decree that completely abolished slavery on British territory and provided 20 million pounds as compensation for the slaveholders. The British government went further and persuaded other European countries to follow its example in allowing British warships to seize slave ships flying other flags. Complete success was not possible until various countries in the New World gradually abolished slavery as an institution &ndash; as did Haiti in 1803, the United Sates in 1863, Brazil in 1888, Cuba at about the same time, and so forth.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-45"><b class="calibre9">COLONIALISM IN LATIN AMERICA</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was Latin America Colonised?</b></i></span> The year 1519, in which Magellan left on his famous voyage around the world, was also the year Hernando Cortes left Cuba on his equally famous expedition against the Aztec Empire. In doing so, Cortes began what might be termed the age of the <i class="calibre8">conquistadors.</i> The preceding decades, from 1500 to 1520, had been the age <a id="calibre_link-360" class="calibre10"></a>of the explorers, when numerous navigators under various flags probed the entire length of the Americas in search of a passageway. In the 30 years that followed, a few thousand Spanish adventurers won the first great European overseas empire.</p>
<p class="indent">By 1550, the conquistadors had completed their work. The way was now clear for the Spaniards to proceed with the development of their overseas possessions. Since the native populations were not so dense or so highly organised as those of Africa and Asia, it was possible for the Iberians to settle in considerable numbers in the New World and to impose their cultures. Thus they built up Europe’s first true colonial empire &ndash; something quite different from the purely commercial empires in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p class="indent">The swashbuckling conquistadors were effective as empire builders but quite ineffective as empire administrators. Incapable of settling down, they fell to fighting among themselves, and their ranks were decimated by feuding and warfare. The Spanish crown replaced the conquistadors with bureaucrats who imposed royal authority and royal justice.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Nature of its Administration?</b></i></span> At the top of the imperial administrative structure was the Council of the Indies, located in Spain and closely supervised by the crown. It made all important appointments and exercised general jurisdiction over colonial affairs. Supreme authority in the New World was entrusted to two viceroys who sat in Mexico City and Lima, respectively. The official in Mexico City headed the viceroyalty of New Spain, which was made up of all the Spanish territories in North America together with the West Indies, Venezuela, and the Philippines. The Lima official presided over the viceroyalty of Peru that was made up of the remaining Spanish possessions in South America. These two vast viceroyalties were subdivided into smaller units ruled by <i class="calibre8">audiencias</i> or courts. Audiencias were staffed by professional lawyers who usually had no excessive family pride or military ambition and therefore made ideal royal servants. In the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, there were 10 such audiencias in the New World.</p>
<p class="indent">A basic problem of Spanish administration in the Americas was the treatment of the Indians. The crown granted to deserving conquistadors, known as “protectors”, or <i class="calibre8">encomenderos</i>, the right to draw specified tribute from assigned Indian villages and also to levy forced labour. In return, the encomenderos were required to give military service and to pay the salaries of the parish clergy. The provision for forced labour obviously opened the door to abuse, so it was modified in the mid-16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The natives still could be made to work, but by public officials rather than private encomenderos, and official wage rates had to be paid to the labourers so recruited. Needless to say, these safeguards were not always enforced. The colonies were too far from Madrid and too isolated from each other. Yet the fact remains that the Spaniards discussed seriously and conscientiously the problem of exploitation, for which there were no precedents.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was its Economy Run?</b></i></span> The all-important fact for the economy of the Spanish colonial empire is that, with the work of native labour, a great flood of gold and silver poured in from the mines of Mexico and Bolivia. The law required that all precious metals be taken to the royal offices to be stamped and taxed at the rate of one-fifth their value, the royal <i class="calibre8">quinto</i>. Between 1503 and 1660 Spain received from America a total of 18,600 registered tons of silver and 200 registered tons of gold. Unregistered bullion smuggled into Spain has been variously estimated at from 10 to 50 percent of the total.</p>
<p class="indent">Apart from mining, the principal occupations in Latin America were agriculture and stock-raising in the haciendas, and plantation monoculture in the tropical coastlands. The haciendas employed Indian labour and produced foodstuffs for their own use and for sale to nearby cities and mining settlements. The plantations were quite different, employing mostly imported African slaves and producing only one crop for the European market. The first plantations were evolved for the growing of sugar on the Atlantic islands &ndash; the Azores, Madeiras, Cape Verdes, and Canaries. Later this institution was further developed, first in the sugar plantations of Brazil and the West Indies, and later in the tobacco, cotton, and coffee plantations of North and South America.</p>

<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a">General Survey</h3>
<p class="noindent">During the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, Portugal had established supremacy in the Far East. In the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, however, the Dutch, English, and French aggressively entered the area. The Dutch were the first. In 1602, all the competing Dutch companies interested in Far Eastern trade were joined into a single Dutch East India Company, to which the Dutch government gave almost complete freedom of action. The company soon drove the Portuguese out of the Spice Islands, which became the centre of the Dutch trading empire. In 1641, Malacca on the Malay Peninsula was seized, giving Dutch control of the seas around the East Indies. Ceylon and the Celebes were also captured. The English tried to seize a share of this rich area, but they were driven out by the Dutch as early as 1623. To safeguard the sea route to the Indies, the Dutch established a colony at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. Its growth was slow, but the Dutch influence was eventually strong enough to influence the history of South Africa to the <a id="calibre_link-364" class="calibre10"></a>present. To watch its interests in the Indies, the Dutch East India Company established a Governor-General in Java, who in turn set up several other fortified governmental centres in the island empire.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00103.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">For years after, the Dutch continued to profit from their holdings in the Indies. They demonstrated remarkable skill in utilising the native agricultural economy to produce commodities such as spices that were in great demand in Western Europe. Consequently, their presence disturbed very little the existing patterns of life in the area. The Dutch also made attempts to penetrate China and Japan but enjoyed only limited success, chiefly because neither the Chinese nor the Japanese welcomed them. Both were too strong to permit entrance by force.</p>
<p class="indent">The English, although shut out of the East Indies by the Dutch, made rapid progress toward replacing the Portuguese in India. The English East India Company was chartered in 1600 and given a monopoly of English trade in the East. This company concentrated chiefly on India, slowly forcing the Portuguese to let English traders into the rich land. The company founded its own ‘factories’ (trading posts) at key locations &ndash; Surat, Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta. For a long time the East India Company was content to exploit the trading opportunities available in these cities; the merchants interfered little with Indian affairs and had little influence on Indian society. Rather, the French entered the competition in the Far East. Colbert organised a French East India Company (1664), which soon established a French outpost at Pondicherry in India. From this centre the French company built up a prosperous trade that returned large profits.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Nature?</b></i></span> Though the Portuguese were the first Europeans to come to Indonesia it was the Dutch who became rulers of the country by the end of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and, except for a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars, remained in occupation till the Second World War. The foundation of Dutch colonialism was laid by the Dutch East India Company from whom the Dutch government took control of the islands in 1890. The areas which had hitherto been outside the Dutch control were also brought under their domination by the end of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Dutch colonialism in Indonesia in the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries had gone through three major phases, viz. the Culture System (1830&ndash;70), the Liberal Policy (1870&ndash;1990) and the Ethical policy (1901&ndash;41). Whatever be the nature of the different phases of Dutch colonialism in Indonesia, the basic characteristic of all the phases was the same, that is, the exploitation of the colony (Indonesia) by the metropolis (Holland).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why was the Culture System Introduced?</b></i></span> During the Napoleonic Wars, Holland suffered a great loss of its power and prestige, and its overseas trade had gone into the hands of the British and Americans. However, after Napoleonic Wars, the ‘Convention of London’ in 1814 provided for the restoration by Britain of all the former colonies of the Dutch East India Company (including Indonesia) conquered from Holland since 1803.</p>
<p class="indent">The colony of Indonesia which the Dutch got back was not the same as before. Under the British taxation system introduced by Raffles, the British administration of the Indies during the intervening period, the trade system of the Dutch, that is the cultivation of export crops, which had been the main aim of the Dutch, had been disturbed.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides, the new Dutch Governor-General Vander Capellen, had to deal with a number of revolts in Malaccas, Borneo, the Western Sumatra and Celebes, which cost heavily on the financial resources of the Dutch. The efforts of William, the King of Holland, in establishing the Netherlands Trading Company and the Java Bank did not yield desired results. Moreover, the Java War of 1825&ndash;30 claimed the finances completely.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-365" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was it Introduced?</b></i></span> At this juncture, Bosch was made the new Governor General in 1830, and he proceeded immediately to implement a project that came to be known as the ‘Culture System’. In several ways, it was the old system of forced delivery of commercial crops that was in existence even before, but now it was systematised and implemented with renewed vigour under name of ’Culture System’.</p>
<p class="indent">In this system, the peasant was required to devote one-fifth of his arable land for the culture or growth of the specified paying export crops, or alternatively he had to devote one-fifth of the time to work on government plantations. The Javanese cultivator was considered to be too ignorant to make the best use of his land; he was therefore compelled to set apart a portion of it for the cultivation of export crops as instructed by government and the government would procure the product in lieu of land rent.</p>
<p class="indent">The supplies procured in this manner were to be handled by the Dutch merchants, shipped in Dutch vessels and sold in Holland, which would by this means become once again a world market for tropical produce.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Outcome?</b></i></span> The culture system was a great success, highly profitable to the Dutch. The system was introduced under favourable circumstances, for the Java War had brought much new territory under the Dutch rule. How the Dutch benefited from this new system can be understood from the fact that the country’s exchequer benefited to the extent of some 900 million guilders (Dutch currency) which was utilized for repayment of national debt and building of the Dutch railways.</p>
<p class="indent">For the Indonesians, it was very harmful. The worst hit by it was the native cultivator. From 1832, the element of compulsion was increased. Each residency had to deliver export produce to the value of 2 guilders a head of its population. Further the European and native officials who superintended the system received a percentage of commission on the products of their districts. Hence, they were eager to raise the proceeds as high as possible, and used means prohibited by the government laws and promise to the people. For instance, more than one-fifth of the land was set apart for the government culture and further the best land was set apart for the purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">The produce in excess of government quota was compelled to be sold to the government at low price which is against the original principle. The cultivation of export crops, being unfamiliar to the native, consumed more time than rice and this together with the forced labour (in many cases the native had to work for more than 200 days a year for the government), affected the rice cultivation resulting in widespread famine in central Java in 1848&ndash;1850.</p>
<p class="indent">Against the principles of the culture system, the land rent was collected without exception from even the one-fifth part of the peasant’s land which was devoted for the culture or growth of export crops. This naturally amounted to double taxation. Even rice was included among the export crops in 1843 and this commercialisation of paddy cultivation resulted in further famines and large exodus of people.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why was the Liberal Policy Introduced?</b></i></span> As an outcome of revolutionary movement which shook all Europe in 1848 the Liberal Party came into power in Holland and in 1854, it led to the enactment of a new constitution for Indonesia called ‘Constitutional Regulation’ which brought the Indies under parliamentary control.</p>
<p class="indent">This combined with the publication of an article by Edward Dekkar and of pamphlets especially those by Isaac F. Putte strengthened the struggle against the economic exploitation through the culture system.</p>
<p class="indent">The cry of the liberals against the exploitation of Indonesia by the government was a limited and selfish one. Their advocacy of private <a id="calibre_link-366" class="calibre10"></a>enterprise in place of government controlled culture was largely motivated by the desire of the Dutch private concerns to have greater share in the profit. The private capitalists were demanding the removal of restrictions to their activities.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was it Introduced?</b></i></span> The selfish nature of the liberals and the exploitative character of Dutch colonialism even during the period of the liberal policy will be clear from the following facts. Even though the culture system was abolished in pepper (1862), cloves (1863), indigo, tea and tobacco (all in 1860), the forced culture of sugar and coffee&mdash;the main source of Dutch profit&mdash;was retained. The Sugar Law of 1870 which is considered as the culminating point of the struggle against culture system, provided that the government was to withdraw from the forced culture of sugar only. The forced culture of coffee, which brought by far the maximum profit from the system, remained in force till January 1917. Moreover, no effort was made to abolish the forced labour.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that De Wall’s Agrarian of 1870 protected the natives from alienation of their land by non-Indonesians. However, the immediate reason for this law was that there was such a rush on the part of the Europeans to cultivate culture products for the home market that there was danger that land needed for the production of food stuffs for the native population would be used for other purposes which would result in famine and other law and order problems.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact remains that during the period of the liberal policy even though it began the great age of private enterprises, the exploitation continued. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 accelerated the process further as seen in the establishment of the Netherlands Steam Navigation Company (1870) and the Rotterdam Lloyd (1875). It witnessed the annexations of new territories such as Borneo, Kutei and Billington, where the rich deposits of minerals like tin, coal, etc., attracted the Dutch enterprises.</p>
<p class="indent">The policy of non-intervention was given up in the period of liberal policy and the new policy introduced by the Governor General Vain Haitsz in 1898 known as the ‘Short Declaration’, whereby a chief who recognised the authority of the Dutch was confirmed in his rule, led to a new control over nearly as many as 300 principalities.</p>
<p class="indent">The liberal policy is said to have resulted in some economic progress, like the introduction of railways, post and telegraph, etc. These helped the Dutch planters and industrialists more than the natives. The introduction of railways, for example, helped in opening remote villages and in the quick transport of export crops to the ports.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Outcome?</b></i></span> The outcome of all this liberalism expressed in terms of exports and imports show that the export trade more than doubled in value between 1870 and 1900 and the imports trade quadrupled during the same period. The total value of exports rose from 107.57 million guilders in 1870 to 258.32 millions in 1900 and that of imports rose from 44.45 million guilders to 179.07 million over the same period.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why was the Ethical Policy Introduced?</b></i></span> The essence of the ethical policy was defined as ‘Indonesian Welfare’. It aimed at increasing the economic development, providing social welfare for the Indonesians, expanding educational facilities and carrying out political decentralisation all under the Dutch supervision.</p>
<p class="indent">By 1900, the Dutch public opinion on colonial affairs had come to regard liberalism out of date. It was obvious that the supporters of private enterprise cared little for the interests of the Indonesians, and that the immense power that the private capital had come to yield was in the hands of few corporations able to take common action in defense of their interests.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-367" class="calibre10"></a>Dr. Abraham, who became the Prime Minister of Holland in 1901, wrote a few pamphlets in which he argued that the government must adopt a policy of moral responsibility for native welfare. Thus came into force in 1901 what was known as the ‘Ethical Policy’.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was it Introduced?</b></i></span> Once again after a great showing of noble sentiment, a program of decentralisation and native welfare was set in action. Decentralisation was the new ideal. It envisaged the delegation of power from Hague to Batavia (Indies), from the Governor-General to the local officers, and from the European to Indonesian officers. It also meant the establishment of autonomous organs managing their own affairs in cooperation with the government. In practice, however, the Decentralisation Law of 1903 and the decrees of 1904&ndash;1905 creating local councils consisting of Indonesians, Europeans and the Chinese went no way near the decentralisation scheme which the governor had submitted to the Home Government as far back as 1867. Up to the outbreak of the First World War, the Governor-General, in fact, remained completely under the control of the Home Government and the local autonomy also was only in theory and not in practice.</p>
<p class="indent">In the meantime, the supporters of the ethical policy had turned to the village as the basic unit for the improvement of native welfare. Beginning with Village Regulation of 1906 which provided for a village government, comprising of headman, village officers and village gathering competent to regulate village affairs and provide for its requirements, measures were taken to improve the agricultural production and veterinary care, to establish village schools, provide sound credit and promote public health. Thus, the most elaborate village administration was built. All this autonomy for the villages was only in theory, and in practice there was too much control from above making the villagers antagonistic towards the Dutch rule. The Dutch method in Indonesia has been described as “let me help you, let me show you how to do it, and let me do it for you”.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Outcome?</b></i></span> The ethical policy, which attempted decentralisation, in fact brought too much control, and this resulted in the general hatred among the villagers against the Dutch. The little reform, particularly in the field of education that was carried out, however, awakened the Indonesians, and made them realise the inner contradictions of the colonial rule. This realisation on the part of the Indonesians finally took the shape of their nationalist movement.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-47"><b class="calibre9">IMPERIALISM AND FREE TRADE: RISE OF NEO-IMPERIALISM</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">At the beginning of 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, many nations questioned the importance of colonies. The cost of maintaining armies and fighting wars had exhausted their treasures. However, when the Industrial Revolution created new needs for supplies of raw materials, Europe resumed the scramble for colonies. Many Europeans thought colonies would also provide markets for finished goods. Moreover, advances in military technology meant that colonies could be won with less cost in lives to the mother country. The Europeans also had strategic motives for colonies. Their steam ships needed ports to refuel with coal, and naval bases were needed from which ships could guard sea lanes. Finally, colonies meant prestige and power, and nationalism was on the rise in Europe in 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="indent">The British Empire had its greatest growth under Queen Victoria (1837&ndash;1901). Under two outstanding prime ministers, Benjamin Disraeli and William Gladstone, Britain’s landholding and influence spread. The discovery of diamonds and gold in South Africa caused the Boer War (1899&ndash;1902) in which Britain defeated the Dutch settlers and took over their <a id="calibre_link-368" class="calibre10"></a>lands. With British colonies in Africa, Asia, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean, the British were proud to say that “the sun never sets on the British Empire”.</p>
<p class="indent">Twice as many people lived in France’s colonial possessions as lived in France itself. France had colonies in Africa, the Far East and Latin America. Belgium, Italy, Germany and Holland also sought colonies around the world.</p>
<p class="indent">The consequences of colonisation were different over the world. In China, the economic gains that Western merchants and industries made were at the cost of creating a weak and unstable China. Japan learned to compete with West, and it may be said that Japan’s imperialistic designs in 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century were an outgrowth of these Western influences. In Africa, traditional society was disrupted as Europeans took over the lands and native people were forced to move into the cities, where Africans were treated as inferiors. The boundaries fixed by the Europeans did not always follow traditional tribal boundaries. African economies were managed to favour the Europeans and most capital was European. The advantages that Europeans sought in colonisation often had lasting and harmful effects upon other people.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Imperialism and Free Trade</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was European Imperialism Implemented?</b></i></span> The 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and early 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries stand out in world history as the period when Europe became master of the entire globe directly or indirectly. Europe’s domination was evident not only in the political sphere, in the form of great colonial empires, but also in economic and cultural spheres. It was between 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries that Europe had emerged from its obscurity and gained control of the oceans and relatively empty spaces of the Americans. So far as Asia and Africa were concerned, Europe’s impact was still negligible at the end of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. In Africa, there were only a string of slave trading stations along the coasts and an insignificant settlement of Boers on the Southern tip of the continent. Likewise in India, the Europeans were confined to their few coastal trading posts and had not yet begun to have a substantial effect upon the vast hinterland. In East Asia, the Westerners were rigidly restricted to Canton and Deshima despite their pleas for further contracts. If by some miracle the relations between Europe on the one hand and Africa and Asia on the other hand had been suddenly severed in the last 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, there would have been little left to show for the three centuries of interaction. A few ruined forts and Churches would have been almost the only reminders of the intruders who had come across the sea. Everyday life would have continued along traditional lines as in the past millennia.</p>
<p class="indent">By 1914, this situation changed fundamentally; Europe’s impact had grown immeasurably, both in event and in depth. Vast territories including the entire continent of Africa, with the exception of Liberia and Ethiopia, and the greater part of Asia, had become outright colonial possessions of the European rule. Of the 16,819,000 square miles in Asia, no less than 9,443,000 square miles were under European rule. These included 6,496,000 square miles under Russia, 1,998,000 under Britain, 587,000 under Holland, 248,000 under France, 114,000 under the United States, and a paltry 193 under Germany. In contrast to these tremendous colonial territories, Japan, the only truly independent Asian nation in 1914, accounted for a mere 161,000 square miles.</p>
<p class="indent">The remaining portion of the globe, apart from these colonial possessions and the Europeanised territories, consisted of countries that were nominally independent but were actually semi-colonial. These semi-colonial countries included the great Chinese and Ottoman empires as well as such smaller states as Iran, <a id="calibre_link-369" class="calibre10"></a>Afghanistan and Nepal. All these countries were dominated by European economic and military power. They were allowed to retain a nominal political independence simply because the European powers could not agree on the details of their dismemberment.</p>
<p class="indent">In this way, the entire globe had come under Europe by 1914. It was the extraordinary climax of the long process started a half-millennium earlier when Portuguese captains began to feel their way down the coast of Africa. One peninsula of the Eurasian landmass was now the centre of the world, with a concentration of power altogether unprecedented in past history. The fact that by 1914 Europe’s domination was unprecedented not only in extent but also in depth was evident in the economic control that Europe exercised. Europe had become the banker of the world, providing the capital needed for building transcontinental railroads, digging inter-oceanic canals, opening mines, and establishing plantations. Europe had become not only the banker but also the industrial workshop of the world. By 1870, Europe was responsible for 64.7 percent of the world’s total industrial output.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Impact?</b></i></span> The effect of Europe’s great outpouring of capital and technology was an unprecedented global economic unity. By 1914, over 516,000 kilometres of cables had been laid on ocean beds, as well as a vast network of telegraph and telephone lines on the land surface of the globe. By 1914, over 30,000 ships with a total tonnage of 50 millions carried goods from one part of the world to another. Several canals were built to facilitate world commerce. The most important were the Suez (1869), which shortened the route between Western Europe and India by 4000 miles, and the Panama (1914), which reduced the distance between New York and San Francisco by almost 80000 miles. Continents were opened for economic exploitation by the construction of several transcontinental railroads.</p>
<p class="indent">The economic integration of the continents led to a spectacular increase in overall global productivity. World industrial production multiplied no less than six times between 1860 and 1913, while the value of world trade increased twelve times between 1851 and 1913. Europe, as might be expected, benefited the most from this economic leap forward. Statistics are not available for conditions all over the globe, but it is estimated that the difference in per capita income between colonial or semi-colonial regions and the European metropolitan countries was roughly 3:1 in 1800. By 1914 it had increased to about 7:1.</p>
<p class="indent">The everyday life of the peasant masses in colonial territories had been drastically affected by the shift from a traditional natural economy to a money economy. Money had been used in the earlier period but only in a peripheral manner, and production had been carried on by the peasant households primarily to satisfy family needs. A few commodities might have been sold in the local market, but not for the purpose of making profit. The aim was to get money to meet tax obligations and to buy few essentials such as salt and iron. The transactions and obligations were met by simple barter, and no money changed hands. But a new market economy was introduced when the Europeans appeared with their railroads, their machine-made goods and their insatiable demands for foodstuff, and industrial raw materials. Before long the peasants found themselves producing for an international market rather than for themselves and their neighbours, which in turn meant that they became subject to global economic fluctuations. They were at the mercy of merchants and money-lenders who now flourished in the new economy. The transition from a closed and static natural economy to a dynamic money and market economy was beneficial so far as productive capacity was concerned but certainly its initial effects were disruptive and uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-370" class="calibre10"></a>The way of thinking as well as the way of life was affected by Europe’s intrusion. However, this intellectual change primarily involved the small upper class in the colonial world rather than the peasant masses. It was the few members of the thin upper crust who knew Western languages, who read Western newspapers and books and who were familiar with European history and current politics. This initial response to this exposure to the alien culture was often an enthusiastic, uncritical admiration of everything western. But it was usually followed by a reaction against the west and an attempt to preserve and foster at least some elements of the traditional culture.</p>
<p class="indent">The political, economic and cultural dominance of Europe at the turn of the century naturally led Europeans to assume that their primacy arose from the superiority of their civilisation and that this, in turn, reflected their superiority as a race. It was confidently believed that God had created people unequal. He had made the whites more intelligent so that they could direct the labour and guide the development of the inferior races who had broad backs and weak minds. Hence arose the concept of the “White Man’s Burden” &mdash; a preaching that cloaked the imperialism of the times with a mantle of idealistic devotion to duty. On all continents, the European masters accepted the homage of the ‘lesser breeds’ as part of the divine nature of things, as the inevitable outcome of the ‘survival of the fittest’. In India, they were addressed respectfully as ‘Sahib’, in the Middle East as ‘Effendi’, in Africa as ‘Bwana’, and in Latin America as ‘Patron’. Under these circumstances, it is scarcely surprising that Europeans came to view the world with myopia and a self-centeredness that today seems incredible.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Rise of Neo-Imperialism</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Neo-Imperialism?</b></i></span> The great wave of empire building after 1870 was known as the “neo-imperialism”. It made a large part of the earth’s surface into an appendage of a few European powers. The inter-relationship of the neo-imperialism and the industrial revolution was manifested in a growing desire to obtain colonies that might serve as markets for the rising volume of manufactured goods. The several European and overseas countries that became industrialised during the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century were soon competing with each other for markets. In the process they raised tariffs to keep out each other’s products. Soon it was being argued that each industrialised country must have colonies to provide “sheltered markets” for its manufactures.</p>
<p class="indent">The industrial revolution also produced surplus capital, which again led the Great Powers to seek colonies as investment outlets. The more capital piled up at home, the lower the profits fell and the greater the need to find better investment markets abroad. Vast amounts of capital were, in fact, invested in foreign countries, especially by Britain, France, and Germany. For example, Britain by 1914 had invested £4 billion abroad, a sum amounting to one-fourth of its total national wealth. Europe by 1914 had become the banker of the world. In the first half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, most overseas investments were made in the Americas and Australia &ndash; in the white man’s world. In the century’s second half they were made mostly in the non-white and relatively unstable countries of Asia and Africa. The thousands of small private investors and the large banking combinations that provided the capital naturally were anxious about their investments safety. They preferred “civilised” administration, preferably by their own respective governments, in the regions in which their investments were situated. This is how the need to invest surplus capital safety promoted the neo-imperialism.</p>
<p class="indent">The Industrial Revolution also created a demand for raw materials to feed the machines. Many of these materials &ndash; jute, rubber, <a id="calibre_link-371" class="calibre10"></a>petroleum, and various metals &ndash; came from the ‘uncivilised’ portions of the globe. In most cases heavy capital outlays were needed to secure adequate production of these commodities. Such investments, as we have seen, usually led to the imposition of political control.</p>
<p class="indent">The neo-imperialism was not entirely economic in its origins; it was not related exclusively to the Industrial Revolution. A variety of other factors also were operative at this time. One was the desire to strengthen national security with strategic naval bases such as at Malta and Singapore. Another was the need to secure additional sources of labour power, as the French did in North Africa. Still another factor was the influence of the missionaries, who were particularly active during the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Sometimes these missionaries were maltreated, or even killed, by the natives they were seeking to convert. Even though the missionaries themselves might be willing to tolerate such risks for the sake of their cause, public opinion frequently demanded action. It was not unknown for governments to use such incidents as pretexts for military intervention. Finally, the vogue of Social Darwinism, with its doctrines of struggle for existence and survival of the fittest, led naturally to ideas of racial superiority. The white man’s ‘burden’ was to rule over the “inferior” coloured peoples of the earth. The great empire builder Cecil Rhodes was quite outspoken on this matter. “I contend that we are the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race.... If there be a God, I think what He would like me to do is to paint as much of the map of Africa British red as possible”.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was its Nature and Course?</b></i></span> The net result of these economic, political, and intellectualpsychological factors was the greatest landgrab in the history of the world, unequalled even by the conquests of Genghis Khan. In the generation between 1871 and 1900, Britain added 4.25 million square miles and 66 million people to its Empire; France added 3.5 million square miles and 26 million people; Russia in Asia added half a million square miles and 6.5 million people, and Germany one million square miles and 13 million people. Even little Belgium managed to acquire 900,000 square miles and 8.5 million inhabitants. These conquests, along with the existing colonial possessions, created a fantastic and unprecedented situation in which one small portion of the globe dominated all the rest.</p>
<p class="indent">The industrialised European powers not only owned these vast colonial territories outright, they also dominated those economically and militarily weak areas that, for one reason or another, were not actually annexed. Examples are China, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia, all of which were nominally independent, but which, in fact, were constantly harried, humiliated, and controlled in various direct and indirect ways. Latin America also was an economic appendage of the Great Powers, though in this region military action by Europe was discouraged by the Monroe Doctrine. The Doctrine, however, did not preclude repeated armed intervention by the United States Marine Corps to ‘restore law and order’. The great Russian Empire was also dominated economically to a very large extent by Western Europe, but in this case the military strength of the tsarist regime was great enough to prevent foreign economic influence from extending into other areas. Thus we see that Europe’s control extended not only over its far-flung empires but also over the equally extensive dependent regions. In fact, more European capital was invested in the dependent countries than in the colonies.</p>
<p class="indent">Investments were safeguarded through various devices and pressures such as military missions that trained the local armed forces, financial missions that supervised and usually controlled local finances, and extraterritorial and capitulatory arrangements that gave <a id="calibre_link-372" class="calibre10"></a>special privileges to Europeans residing or doing business in these areas. If necessary as a last resort, there were always the Marines in the New World or the gunboats in the Old. In this manner most of the earth’s surface and most of the world’s population had by 1914 come under the direct or indirect domination of a few European countries, including Russia, and of the United States. This was a development without precedence in human history. Today, in the early 21<sup class="calibre13">st</sup> century, much of the global turmoil represents the inevitable reaction to this European domination.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Impact?</b></i></span> Why should we label the great European expansion of the late-nineteenth century the ‘‘neo-imperialism’? Imperialism, after all, was not something new. If it is defined as ‘the rule or control, political or economic, direct or indirect, of one state, nation or people over similar groups’, then imperialism is as old as human civilisation. Certainly the Romans were imperialistic, having conquered and for centuries ruled large parts of Europe and the Near East. And many other empires in all parts of the globe, both before and after the Romans, were conquered by all types of peoples.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet the term “neo-imperialism” is justified, because the late-19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>-century European expansion was quite unique in its impact upon the colonial and dependent territories. Rome exploited its possessions simply and directly by plundering and by collecting tribute, chiefly in the form of foodstuffs, but its exploitation did not particularly affect the economic life and structure of the colonies. They continued to produce pretty much the same foodstuffs and handicrafts in the same ways as in the past. To compare this imperialism with the later version that overran and remade entire continents is like comparing a spade to a steam shovel. The traditional imperialism involved exploitation but no basic economic and social change. The tribute merely went to one ruling clique rather than another. The neo-imperialism, by contrast, forced a thorough transformation of the conquered countries. This was not so much deliberate policy as it was the inevitable impact of the dynamic industrialism of Western Europe upon the static, self-contained agrarian regimes of Africa and Asia. In other words, Europe’s industrial capitalism was far too complex and expansionistic to stop with a simple tribute relationship with the colonies.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00130.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-373" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00013.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">At the outset, the European conquerors certainly did not hesitate to plunder and to levy tribute. The British did so in India, as the Spaniards had earlier in Mexico and in Peru. But after this initial phase, Europe’s dynamic economy began in various ways to enfold and refashion the colonial economic and social structures. This happened because industrialised Europe needed sources of raw materials and markets for its surplus capital and manufactures. The historic role of the neo-imperialism was to carry the Industrial Revolution to its logical conclusion &ndash; to enable the industrial nations, or industrial capitalism, to operate on a worldwide scale. The global operation of industrial capitalism resulted in much more extensive, coordinated, and efficient use of the material and human resources of the globe. Certainly world productivity rose greatly when European capital and skills were combined with the raw materials and labour power of the underdeveloped regions. The combination produced, for the first time, an integrated global economy. In fact, world industrial production increased threefold between 1860 and 1890, and sevenfold between 1860 and 1913. The value of world trade grew from £641 million in 1851, to £3024 million in 1880, to £4025 million in 1900, and to £7840 million in 1913.</p>
<p class="indent">Everyone agrees that this increase in the size of the economic cake has been a great advantage. But there is much dispute over the question of how the cake has been sliced. Colonial people feel that in the past they have had less than their due share. The total <a id="calibre_link-374" class="calibre10"></a>amount that they have received obviously has increased, otherwise their rising populations could not have been supported. For example, a British economist has shown that in 1949 European companies engaged in mining in mineral-rich Northern Rhodesia sold their output for a total of £36.7 million. Of this, they spent only £12.5 million in Northern Rhodesia, which meant that two-thirds of the money was transferred abroad. Moreover, of the £12.5 spent in Northern Rhodesia, £4.1 million was paid to Europeans living and working there. Only £ 2 million out of the £ 36.7 million went to the Africans working in the mines. Yet these workers were receiving an average of £ 41 a year compared to an average income of £27 a year per adult African male in the colony.</p>
<p class="indent">Under these circumstances, it is understandable that colonial people are not very impressed by increased productivity or by the wages paid by foreign companies. They are more impressed by the wretched level at which they subsist, especially in comparison with western levels. They also resent being cast in the role of hewers of wood and drawers of water, even in regions where there are human and material resources for industrial development.</p>
<p class="indent">There is an obvious parallel here between the reaction of western workers to industrial capitalism and of colonial people to the neo-imperialism. Both have been dissatisfied with their lot, and both have supported movements designed to bring about radical change. A basic difference is that colonial people are ranged not against employers of their own nationality but rather against foreign rulers. Accordingly, their movement of protest, at least in the first stage, was not socialism, but rather a range of western political doctrines &ndash; liberalism, democracy, and, above all, nationalism.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-48"><b class="calibre9">COLONIALISM AND IMPERIALISM IN AFRICA</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Begin?</b></i></span> The Portuguese were the first to establish trading posts along Africa’s west coast and acquire gold, ivory, and African slaves in the 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. For more than a century, Portugal held an almost unbroken monopoly of European relations with tropical Africa. The Portuguese sought to exploit it in a selective manner. Hence, except in a few relatively small areas, the economic and political life of the African people continued as it had done before. In fact, the Portuguese were more the harbingers of change than the actual agents of change. They showed other Europeans, with greater maritime and commercial strength than they themselves had, that there was profit to be made out of contract with Africa. By the close of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the Portuguese for example, had demonstrated to the other West Europeans that the real value of Africa was not as a source of gold or spices or as an expanding frontier for Christendom, but as a continent where slaves could be acquired for exploitation in America.</p>
<p class="indent">The Dutch East India Company overthrew Portuguese supremacy in the Indian Ocean in the first decade of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and between 1637 and 1642 captured all the major Portuguese settlements on the west coast of Africa. These led to the incorporation of tropical Africa into a dynamic world trading system dominated by the Europeans. Soon, the Dutch also gave way to the British and French whose governments were not inclined to allow their American colonists to become tied to Dutch merchants for their supplies of slaves and other forms of capital with the resultant possibility that much of the marketing of their produce in Europe would be in Dutch hands.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, the latter part of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century was one in which a number of major European trading companies were vying with one another for the trade of West African coastlands. The competition was more severe because, many times during the numerous colonial wars of the time, the companies, as representatives of their nation’s interest in Africa, called upon the armed support of the new national navies. <a id="calibre_link-375" class="calibre10"></a>Because of this, much of the competition in West Africa centred around the possession of coastal ports.</p>
<p class="indent">The new pattern of trade became manifest with the increase in American demand for slaves and as European activities extended further into Africa. Yet the right to trade was the prerogative of the African rulers and was granted to any European who was prepared to acknowledge African sovereignty and to pay the legal dues and taxes. Though the Europeans were prepared to exchange their goods (print cloth, raw materials, manufactured hardware, muskets, shot-power, brandy, rum and gin, beads and other trinkets) for many African products which would bring them profit, it was the ever-increasing American demand for slaves which principally explains the wide expansion and great growth of European trading activity from the middle of the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century onwards. There was also a continuous demand for gold.</p>
<p class="indent">The consequences of the growth of salve trade in West Africa were of two kinds: those due to its particular character as a trade in men and those due to the fact that the continuous growth in this demand for men spearheaded a great increase in volume of major trading activities and in the number of people and the extent of territory involved in these activities. Increasing trade led to the organisation of trade as also the use of regular currency. One more result was the emergence of a new class of men to which the term ‘merchant-princes’ is often applied. These were men, often of humble origin, who had based their commercial acumen to break out from some of the restrictions of traditional society, to accumulate personal wealth and slaves. This class was naturally most in evidence in or around the coast. This also led to the increase in wealth and prosperity of coastal towns, and soon coastal areas were transformed into city states, as also individual wealth and power, lay in accumulation of considerable quantities of slaves.</p>
<p class="indent">Until 1800, the major part of “Bantu Africa” (Africa south of the Equator) was little affected in any direct sense by the increasing trade which had induced so many changes in West Africa. The most precious resource here was ivory. The growth in the demand for ivory meant that mainland people who had access to elephants and who had developed skills in hunting them began to see that they had within their grasp a resource of considerable value. When they began to exhaust their local supplies of ivory, they began to organise hunting bands to penetrate further into the interior to find more elephants. Along with ivory, the slave trade also increased. In the late 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, a few luxury items were also brought here. The political and social consequences of this penetration of external trades into Eastern Bantu Africa were considerable. Traditional life was disrupted. The only exception to this was the non-Bantu pastoral people, like Morai, who remained hostile and aloof.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why and How was Africa Colonised?</b></i></span> By the dawn of the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the map of Africa looked like a huge jigsaw puzzle, with most of the boundary lines having been drawn in a sort of game of give-and-take played in the foreign offices of the leading European powers. The division of Africa, the last continent to be so carved up, was essentially a product of the new imperialism (1875&ndash;1914). Vividly highlighting its essential features like the notable speedup in colonial acquisitions, the timing and the pace of the scramble for Africa are especially noteworthy. Before 1800, colonial possessions in Africa were relatively few and limited to coastal areas, with largest of the coastlines and almost all the interior still independent. By 1900, however, Africa was almost entirely divided into separate territories controlled by European powers. The only exceptions were Liberia (generally regarded as being under the special protection of the USA), Morocco (conquered by France a few years later), Libya (later taken over by Italy) and Ethiopia.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-376" class="calibre10"></a>The second feature of the new imperialism was also strongly evident. It was in Africa that Germany made its first major bid for membership in the club of colonial powers. Between May 1884 and February 1885, Germany announced its claims to territory in South West Africa, Togoland, Cameroon and part of the East African coast opposite Zanzibar. Two smaller nations, Belgium and Italy, also entered the ranks, and even Portugal and Spain once again became active in bidding for African territory. The increasing number of participants in itself spread up the race for conquest. With the heightened rivalry came more intense concern for preclusive occupation, increased attention to military arguments for additional buffer zones and in a period when free trade was giving way to protective tariffs and discriminatory practices in colonies as well as at home, a growing urgency for protected overseas markets. Not only the wish but also the means were at hand for this carving up of the African pie. Repeating rifles, machine guns and other advances in weaponry gave the small armies of the conquering nations the effective power to defeat the much larger armies of both advanced and technically backward people of Africa. Rapid railroad construction provided the means for military, political and economic consolidation of continental interiors. With the new steamships, men and materials could be moved to Africa with greater dispatch; and bulk shipments of raw materials and food from Africa, prohibitively costly for some products in the days of the sailing ships, became economically feasible and profitable.</p>
<p class="indent">Penetration of the Islamic North Africa was complicated, on the one hand, by the struggle among European powers for the control of the Mediterranean Sea and, on the other hand, by the suzerainty that the Ottoman Empire exercised to a greater or lesser extent over large sections of the region. Development in both respects contributed to the wave of partition towards the end of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. First, Ottoman power was perceptibly waning. The military balance had tipped decisively in favour of the European nations, and Turkey was becoming increasingly dependent on loans from European centres of capital. Second, the importance of domination of the Mediterranean increased significantly after Suez Canal was opened in 1869.</p>
<p class="indent">France was the only European nation that had established a major beachhead in Islamic North Africa before the 1880s. At a time when Great Britain was preoccupied to interfere, the French captured the fortress of Algiers in 1830. Frequent revolts kept the French Army busy in the Algerian interior for another 50 years before all Algeria was under full French rule.</p>
<p class="indent">While Tunisia and Egypt had been areas of great interest to European powers during the long period of France’s Algerian take-over, the penetration of these countries had been informal, confined to diplomatic and financial maneuvers. Italy, as well as France and England, had loaned large sums to the ruling ‘Begs’ of Tunisia to help loosen that country’s ties with Turkey. The inability of the Begs to service the foreign debt in the 1870s led to the installation of debt commissioners by the lenders.</p>
<p class="indent">Tunisia’s revenues were pledged to pay the interest due on outstanding bonds. With this came increased pressure on the people for large tax payments and a growing popular dissatisfaction with a government that had ‘sold out’ to foreigners. The weakness of the ruling group, intensified by the danger of popular revolt or a military coup, opened the door further for formal occupation by one of the interested foreign powers. When Italy’s actions showed that it might be preparing for outright possession, France jumped the gun by invading Tunisia in 1881 and completed its conquest by defeating the rebellions precipitated by this occupation.</p>
<p class="indent">The course of Egypt’s loss of sovereignty resembled somewhat the same process as in Tunisia; easy credit extended by Europeans, <a id="calibre_link-377" class="calibre10"></a>bankruptcy, increasing control by foreign debt commissioners, overtaxing the peasants to raise revenue for servicing the debt, growing independence movements and, finally, military conquest by a foreign power. In Egypt, interimperialist rivalry, mainly between Great Britain and France, reached back to the early 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century but was intensified under the circumstances of the new imperialism and the construction of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal was a strategic link to the British Empire and its eastern trade and colonial interests. The successful nationalist revolt headed by the Egyptian army imminently threatened in the 1860s the interests of both powers. France, occupied with war in Tunisia and with internal political problems, did not participate in the military intervention to suppress the revolt. Great Britain bombarded Alexandria in 1882, landed troops and thus obtained control of Egypt. Unable to find a stable collaborationist government that would also pay Egypt’s debts and concerned with suppressing not only the rebellion but also a powerful anti-Egyptian Mahdist revolt in Sudan, Britain completely took over the reins of government in Egypt.</p>
<p class="indent">The rest of North Africa was carved up in the early 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. France, maneuvering for possession of Morocco, which bordered on her Algerian Colony, tried to obtain acquiescence of the other powers by both secret and open treaties granting Italy a free hand in Libya, allotting Spain a sphere of influence, and Germany’s ambitions, now backed by an increasingly effective army and navy. The tension created by Germany led to an international conference at Algiers (1906), which produced a short-lived compromise, including recognition of France’s paramount interest, Spanish participation in policing Morocco, and an open door for the country’s economic penetration by other nations. France’s vigorous pursuit of her claims, reinforced by the occupation of Casablanca and surrounding territory, precipitated critical confrontations, which reached their peak in 1911 when French troops were suppressing a Moroccan revolt and a German cruiser appeared before Agadir in a show of force. The resulting settlements completed the European partition of North Africa. France obtained the lion’s share of Morocco, Germany received a large part of the French Congo, Italy was given the green light for her war with Turkey over control of Tripoli, the first step in her eventual acquisition of Libya and Spain was enabled to extend her Rio de-Oro protectorate to the Southern frontier of Morocco. The more or less peaceful trade offs by the occupying powers differed sharply from the long, bitter, and expensive wars they waged against the indigenous peoples and rulers of Islamic North Africa to consolidate European rule.</p>
<p class="indent">The partition of sub-Saharan Africa, i.e., Africa below the Sahara, took place at two levels: (1) on paper &ndash; in deals made among colonial powers who were seeking colonies partly for the sake of the colonies themselves and partly as pawns in the power play of European nations struggling for world dominance., and (2) in the filed &ndash; in battles of conquest against African states and tribes and in military confrontations among the rival powers themselves. This process produces, over and above the ravages of colonialism, a wasp’s nest of problems that was to plague African nations long after they achieved independence. Boundary lines between colonies were often drawn arbitrarily, with little or no attention to ethnic unity, regional economic ties, tribal migratory patterns, or even natural boundaries.</p>
<p class="indent">Before the race for partition, only three European powers (France, Portugal and Britain) had territory in tropical Africa, located mainly in West Africa, but only France had moved into the interior along the Senegal river. However, the ground for eventual occupation of the interior of tropical Africa was being gradually prepared by explorers, missionaries and <a id="calibre_link-378" class="calibre10"></a>traders. Such penetration remained tenuous until the contraction of railroads and the arrival of steamships on navigable waterways made it feasible for European merchants to dominate the trade of the interior and for European governments to consolidate conquest.</p>
<p class="indent">In West Africa, Germany concentrated on consolidating her passions of Togo land and Cameroon, while England and France pushed northward and eastward from their bases. England concreted on the Niger region, the centre of its commercial activity, while France aimed at joining its possessions at Lake Chad within a grand design for an empire of contiguous territories from Algeria to the Congo. Final boundaries were arrived at after the British and the French had defeated the resisting tribes and kingdoms in their respective areas. The boundaries determined by conquest and agreement between the conquerors gave France the lion’s share. In addition to the extension of its former coastal possessions, France acquired French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa, while Britain carved out its Nigerian colony.</p>
<p class="indent">In Central Africa, the inter-colonial rivalries chiefly involved the British, the Portuguese, the South African Republic of the Transvaal, the British backed Cape colony, and the Germans. The acquisitive drive was enormously stimulated by dreams of wealth generated by the discovery of diamonds and gold. Encouraged by these discoveries, Cecil Rhodes (heading the British South Africa Company) and other entrepreneurs expected to find gold, copper and diamonds in the regions surrounding the Transvaal. In the ensuing struggle, Britain obtained control over Bechuana land and through the British South Africa Company, over the areas later designated as the Rhodesias and Nyasaland. At the same time, Portugal moved inland to seize control over the colony of Mozambique. It was clearly the rivalries of stronger powers, especially the concern of Germany and France over the extension of British rule in Central Africa, that enabled a weak Portugal to have its way in Angola and Mozambique.</p>
<p class="indent">The boundary lines in East Africa were arrived at largely in settlements between Britain and Germany, the two chief rivals in that region. For the first area of friction, viz., Zanzibar and Tanganyika, separate spheres of influence were established in the 1886 Anglo-German agreement. A final division of the area coveted by both powers was reached in an overall Anglo-German treaty of 1890. Britain obtained the future Uganda and recognition of its paramount interest in Zanzibar island of Hoagland and non-interference in Germany’s acquisition of Tanganyika, Ruanda and Urindi. As part of her consolidation of control over Uganda and its resources, Britain began to build an East African railroad to the coast, establishing the East African Protectorate (later Kenya) covering the area through which the railroad was built.</p>
<p class="indent">Rivalry in Northeast Africa between the French and British centred on domination of the upper end of the Nile. Italy, the third power in the race, had established itself at two ends of Ethiopia. Its penetration into the interior led to was with Ethiopia and defeat at the hands of the Ethiopian army at Adowa (1896). The unprecedented victory by an African state over a European army strengthened French influence in Ethiopia (Ethiopia had French military advisers during its war with Italy) and enabled France to stage military expeditions from Ethiopia as well as from the Congo to order to establish footholds on the upper Nile. War between France and Britain was narrowly avoided in a settlement in 1898 that completed the partition of the region; eastern Sudan to be ruled jointly by Britain and Egypt, while France was to possess the remaining part of Sudan.</p>
<p class="indent">The entry of Germany into South Africa through occupation and conquest of Southwest <a id="calibre_link-379" class="calibre10"></a>Africa sparked off an upsurge of British colonial activity in that area notably the separation of Lesotho as a Crown colony from the Cape colony and the annexation of Zululand. The thorn in the side of British interests, however, was the independence of the Transvaal, which was rich in gold, has its own ambitions to expand, and was a potential area of German infiltration. In the acquisition spirit of the new imperialism, Britain provoked war with the Boers (1899&ndash;1902), at the end of which she obtained sovereignty over the Transvaal as well as the Afrikaner Orange Free State.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Positive Impact?</b></i></span> The most important positive political consequence was the establishment of a relatively a greater degree of peace and stability in Africa. The 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century Africa was one of instability and insecurity. In fact, from 1890 to 1930, this was intensified and caused wholesale and unpardonable destruction and loss of life. With colonial occupation liberation came to an end. Hence, most parts of Africa, especially from the end of the First World War enjoyed a great degree of continuous peace and stability.</p>
<p class="indent">The emergence of the modern independent nations of Africa as geo-political entities was another positive effect. The colonial conquest and partition led to a drastic reshaping of the political face of Africa. In place of the independent clan and lineage groups, which were without any clearly marked boundaries, city states, kingdoms and empires with fixed boundaries were now established. It is important to note that boundaries of the states as laid down in the colonial era have remained almost the same since independence.</p>
<p class="indent">Another positive political consequence was the birth of not only a new type of African nationalism but also of Pan-Africanism. The former was the fostering of a sense of identity and consciousness among the various classes or ethnic groups inhabiting each of the new states, while the latter was a sense of identity of black-men the world over. Various movements, political parties, youth leagues, associations, religious sects and newspapers were vehicles of articulation of African nationalism, while Pan-African congresses were those of Pan-Africanism. The colonial system also introduced in most parts of Africa two new institutions, viz., a new judicial system and a new bureaucracy both based on western models.</p>
<p class="indent">The best positive economic outcome can be seen in the primary sector of African economy. Since every effort was made to develop or exploit some of the rich natural resources of the continent. The full mineral potential of Africa was realised and the mining industry boomed. While the cultivation of cash crops, such as cocoa, coffee, tobacco, groundnuts, and rubber spread, this Economic Revolution had far-reaching results: (a) the commercialisation of land which made it a real asset (Before the colonial era, huge tracts of land in many parts of Africa were not only under-populated but also underutilised: but the introduction and spread of cash crops and mining industry put an end to all this); (b) an increase in the purchasing power of some Africans and with it an increase in their demand for consumer goods; (c) the ability of African individuals of whatsoever social status, especially in rural areas, to acquire wealth.</p>
<p class="indent">Another positive economic outcome was the introduction of money economy. By 1920s whole of Africa has been drawn into money economy. The results of this change were: (a) a new standard of wealth had been introduced which was based not only on the number sheep or cows one possessed but on actual cash; (b) people were engaged in activities not for subsistence alone but also to earn money which in turn led to the emergencies of a new class of wage &ndash; earners and salaried groups; (c) commencement of banking activities in Africa. The introduction of money economy, banking activities and tremendous expansion of trade between colonial Africa and Europe led to the completion of the integration of Africa into the economy of the western world. One more positive economic consequence was the provision of an infrastructure of motor roads, railways, telegraphs, etc. These did not exist in the pre-colonial Africa.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-380" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00039.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Colonisation of Africas 1913</p>
<p class="indent">The most beneficial social result was the new social structure that had emerged in some parts of Africa and which later spread to other parts as <a id="calibre_link-381" class="calibre10"></a>well. In contrast to the traditional social structure which placed too much importance on birth, the new colonial order emphasised individual merit and achievement rather than birth. This change, together with abolition of slavery, introduction of western education, Christianity and Islam, commercialisation of agriculture which facilitated acquisition of wealth in some areas, and many other avenues for advancement that the new colonial order introduced, radically altered traditional social structure. Thus, by 1930s in place of the pre-colonial social classes of traditional ruling aristocracy, the ordinary people, domestic slaves and a relatively small educated elite, there emerged a new society that had become more sharply divided than before into urban and rural dwellers, each of which was differently stratified. The urban people came to be divided into three main groups: (a) the elite consisting of bureaucrats, bankers and high merchants; (b) the sub-elite consisting of brokers, middlemen, clerks, teachers, nurses and junior civil servants; and (c) urban proletariat consisting of wage earners, store assistants, drivers, merchants, tailors, etc. In rural areas, there emerged for the first-time new classes, namely a rural proletariat to landless labourers and peasants.</p>
<p class="indent">Next was the overall increase in the populations of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5% after its decline during the first 2 or 3 decades of colonialism, this increase was due to the establishments of an economic base, spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas and campaigns launched against epidemic diseases, such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.</p>
<p class="indent">Urbanisation was another positive social effect. Though urbanisation was not unknown in pre-colonial Africa, now the pace of urbanisation increased significantly. Many towns were established. They were either new capitals and administrative centres or new harbours and railway terminals or the new mining and commercial centres.</p>
<p class="indent">On more important positive social impact was the provision of a ‘lingual franca’ for each colony or set of colonies. In all colonies, mother tongue of colonial powers, either in its pure or modified form, became official language, and in many cases the main means of communication among numerous linguistic groups that comprised the population of each colony.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Negative Impact?</b></i></span> The negative impact of colonialism and imperialism in Africa for outweighed its positive impact. The negative impact can be seen clearly in the political field. To begin with, Nationalism in Africa grew with the oppressive, discriminatory, humiliating and exploitative measures introduced by the colonial rulers and was not a result of identity with the nation-state. Then with the overthrow of colonial rulers from the middle of the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the feeling of nationalism was bound to lose its momentum.</p>
<p class="indent">Further while new geo-political set up that sprang up was an asset, it nevertheless created far more problems that it solved. Though boundaries of states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that rose were artificial creations and this artificially created a number of problems for further development of the continent. Some of the boundaries, for instance, cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this caused widespread social disruptions and displacements. Another outcome of the artificially and arbitrations of the colonial divisions was that the states that emerged were of different sizes with unequal national resources and economic potentialities. The problems of development posed by the lack of or limited natural resources, limited fertile land and lack of access to the sea for the independent African states can be visualised.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-382" class="calibre10"></a>Another negative political outcome was the growth of an attitude that government and all public property belonged not to the people but rather to white colonial rulers and could, therefore, be taken advantage of at the best opportunity. This attitude was a direct product of the remote nature of the colonial administration and the elimination of an overwhelming majority of Africans, both educated and uneducated, from the decision making process.</p>
<p class="indent">The genesis of the practices of military intervention in the politics of the states was one more unwanted consequence. Before the consolidation of colonialism in Africa no Africa state had a standing army. All adults including even members of the ruling aristocracy became soldiers in time of wars and civilians in times of peace. Standing armies were created in the 1880s and 90s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and finally for persecution of global wars and suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rule, these armies were nor disbanded but were taken over by the government of the independent states. In fact in most of the African states, the standing armies played important roles in the transition from colonial rule to indigenous rule due to the internal squabbling.</p>
<p class="indent">The last, but not the least, important negative political impact was the loss of African sovereignty and independence, and the right of Africans to shape their own destiny or deal directly with the outside worlds. Even after the decolonisation of Africa, the former colonial powers maintained their links with their former colonies and continued to exercise indirect control over them, particularly due to the former’s economic dependence over the latter.</p>
<p class="indent">The economic development as it occurred in African colonies was based on the natural resources of the area, and therefore, those areas that were not naturally gifted were totally neglected. This led to sharp economic differences in the same colony. This accentuated the regional differences and sentiments which have been a great impediment in the way of nation-building in independent Africa.</p>
<p class="indent">A characteristic feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence, and discouragement of industrialisation and processing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. Simple items like matches, candles, edible oils, and even lime and orange juice &ndash; all these which could have been produced in Africa &ndash; were imported. All African states, therefore, became markets for the manufactured goods from metropolitan countries, and producers of raw materials for export. Not only was industrialisation neglected, but such industries and crafts that had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed.</p>
<p class="indent">Though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no serious attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies. Instead the production of only single or cash crops had become the norm. The period after World War II did not see any improvement in this area. Hence, most of the African states, on attainment of independence, found themselves saddled with mono-crop economies and were, therefore, highly sensitive to the prevailing international trade conditions. Colonialism did, indeed, complete the integration of African economies into world economic order, but in a disadvantageous and exploitative manner and this has not altered ever since.</p>
<p class="indent">The over dependence on cash crops had another negative effect, i.e., negligence of the internal sector of African economy. The economy of Africa had always been divided into two sectors: internal sector which produced both for subsistence of producers and for the <a id="calibre_link-383" class="calibre10"></a>home market, and the export sector which provided for long distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times, with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on production of cash crops during the colonial area, internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were, in fact, compelled to ignore the production of food crops for their consumption in favour of production of cash crops for exports. Food, therefore, had to be imported which ordinary people had to purchase usually at exorbitant prices to feed themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">The infrastructure that was provided by colonialism was not as adequate or as useful as it could have been. Most of the road and railroads were constructed not to open the country but merely to connect the areas, having mineral deposits and potentialities for the production of cash crops with the sea. Nor were they meant to facilitate inter-African travel and communication. Such infrastructure as was provided was meant to facilitate the exploitation of the resources of the colonies and to link them with the metropolitan countries, but not to promote the overall economic development.</p>
<p class="indent">Colonial rule also led to the appearance of an increasing number of expatriate banking, shipping and trading firms and companies. Since it was these firms and companies that controlled exports as well as imports, trade, fixed prices not only of important commodities but also of the exports produced by Africans, the huge profits that accrued from these activities went to these companies and not to the Africans. Thus, Africans were eliminated from the profitable and important sectors of the economy altogether.</p>
<p class="indent">The resultant outcome of the monetary policies pursued by the colonial powers towards their colonies (tying their currencies to those of the colonial powers, introduction of tariff and keeping all foreign exchange earnings in metropolitan capitals) led to the concentration of colonial assets in metropolitan capitals, instead of their being utilised in the colonies. The reparation of savings and deposits of Africans by banks and discrimination practiced against Africans in granting of loans further hampered African economic growth.</p>
<p class="indent">The education system under the colonial rule was hardly sufficient, unevenly distributed and badly oriented, and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been. Out of the five types of institutions (primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university) that were established under the colonial rule, only primary schools were established by 1860s and secondary schools only in the 1920s and 30s, while university and technical education was introduced only towards the end of the colonial era. Moreover, nowhere and at no level did the facilities provided by these institutions were determined by colonial people. Instead they were closely modelled on those of the European continent. The impact of this inadequate, uneven and wrongly oriented education of African societies is profound. For, it left Africa with a huge illiteracy problem &ndash; a problem whose solution will take a long time. Besides, the educated elite that cropped up was by and large an alienated elite, an elite based on European culture and civilisation and which looked down on African culture. Therefore, a gap had come into existence between this elite and the masses, and it has not yet been bridged. Since this elite comprised wealthiest people and they occupied the highest posts available both during and after the colonial era, they came to exercise power and influence out of proportion to their numbers, and relations between them on the one hand and traditional elite on the other hand became strained during the colonial era, and have not yet been bridged.</p>
<p class="indent">The neglect of technical education and the emphasis on liberal and clerical training and <a id="calibre_link-384" class="calibre10"></a>the consequent love for white-collared jobs also created, among the educated, disdain for manual labour and agricultural work which is still prevalent. Moreover, the uneven nature of distribution of educational facilities proved a stumbling block to the uniform process of modernisation in each colony, which further accentuated differences and tensions between ethnic groups and regions. These have remained in many areas and responsible for some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some of the independent African states.</p>
<p class="indent">Colonial rulers did introduce some social services, but these services were highly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony. Besides, they were essentially meant for the benefit of a few white settlers and administrators.</p>
<p class="indent">Most disgustingly the African himself was looked down upon, humiliated and discriminated both overtly and covertly. Even the educated elite, who admired European culture and went out of their way to identity with it, were never given equal treatment. They were barred from the societies of Europeans and were prevented from living in European quarters of the town. Instead of decreasing, this discrimination grew in intensity, culminating in the inhuman philosophy of Apartheid in South Africa. This racial discrimination inevitably created in some Africans a deep sense of inferiority which had not entirely disappeared even after decades of independence.</p>
<p class="indent">In the cultural field, the national arts, crafts, music, dance, etc., were condemned. Consequently, throughout the colonial period, African art, music, dance, and even history were not only ignored but also discouraged. Moreover, the development of ‘lingua franca’ hampered the growth of some of the indigenous languages into national languages.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-49"><b class="calibre9">SEMI-COLONIALISM IN EGYPT</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<p class="noindent"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Condition Under Mohammad Ali Pasha?</b></i> <span>Mohammad Ali’s rise as the first</span> Pasha was a natural outcome of Napoleon Bonaparte’s activity in Egypt. The French forces had landed near Alexandria in July 1798 ostensibly to overthrow the Mamluks (local gentry) and to restore the authority of the Ottoman Sultan. But they could not consolidate their position because of British intervention. The French army remained ineffectual and was eventually withdrawn by agreement with the British in 1801. It, however, had the enormously important effect of bringing to the attention of a few men in Egypt a keen awareness of the advantages of an orderly government and an appreciation of the advances that science and learning had made in Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">Mohammad Ali (1805&ndash;1849), an Albanian, had been sent out by the Turkish Sultan to drive out the French, but he was keen on consolidating his position and that of his successors in hereditary possession of Egypt and was also aware of the fact that if he was to maintain such a position, he must have an army and a navy trained on western lines. As a result, he looked to the western powers, particularly the British and the French for armaments and technical experts. When his overtures to the British were declined, he turned to the French, whose hopes for an empire in India had been shattered.</p>
<p class="indent">Initiating an era of reforms to realise his ambitions, he first struck at the roots of Mamluk power by abolishing their land tenure system. By 1814 itself, he succeeded in vesting the ownership in his government (i.e., in himself), but leaving the use and cultivation of lands in the hands of the existing tenants. The peasant now paid taxes directly to the state. Most of the <i class="calibre8">waqf</i> land was also confiscated and the government was supposed to look after mosques and the religious people. Thus the state was now the landlord, and the peasant was a state-tenant, not a peasant-proprietor. In 1830, he distributed large tracks of this confiscated land apparently to create a social base to perpetuate his regime.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-385" class="calibre10"></a>In agriculture, he began to decide what crops to be cultivated on how much land. Seeds and funds were lent out, and inspectors were employed to carry out the Pasha’s orders. Most of the crops, especially export crops like cotton, were declared government monopolies and such crops were purchased by the government at a fixed price which was sometimes half or even less than half of the market value. From about 1820, he began the construction of numerous canals for the purpose of cultivating by perennial irrigation instead of artificial basins into which the annual Nile flood was admitted to fertilise the ground for the main winter crop. Dam construction was entrusted to French engineers. Thus began the history of permanent irrigational network in Lower Egypt.</p>
<p class="indent">By a series of reforms, he reorganised the industrial sector of Egypt also. In 1815 itself, he declared the existing manufacturers as government monopolies. The government, at a considerable profit to itself, supplied the artisans with the raw materials, bought back the finished articles cheaply and resold them dearly; a number of iron-works were set up and so were arsenals, gunpowder factories, saltpetre works, etc. Along with them, the Pasha set up a number of industries such as textiles, sugar, paper, glass, leather and sulphuric acid.</p>
<p class="indent">His industrial policy, however, did not yield the desired results. For, these industries were on the whole run at a loss on account of high cost of imported machines and spare parts, the lack of suitable overseers, engineers, apathy of the workers (who were paid low wages and pressurised as is the case in state capitalism), waste of raw materials, confusion, delays, etc. By 1840, the strain of the accumulated losses had become evident even to the Pasha.</p>
<p class="indent">It was inevitable that he would reorganise and modernise his armed forces on western lines. French officials and doctors used to accompany his armies in his campaigns. A French colonel was, in fact, engaged to reorganise and train Egyptian army on French lines. Another Frenchman planned and organised the naval dockyard at Alexandria. French military works were translated into Arabic. Separate military colleges to train officers were opened. A number of <i class="calibre8">felaheen</i> (peasants) were converted into soldiers.</p>
<p class="indent">To improve the education system, after 1836, he opened 50 elementary and secondary schools on French lines and got a number of European books on science and technology translated into Egyptian. In order to build a cadre of modern and technically trained young Egyptians, he sent a large number of them to Europe, especially to France to study language, law, astronomy, science and machines. Simultaneously, French personnel were invited to Egypt to teach the Egyptians. Medical colleges were also founded. In 1822, Egypt’s first printing press and newspaper were founded. He also improved the means of transport and communication. The harbour of Alexandria was improved and linked to the Nile by a canal. Many roads and canals were built and old ones repaired for facilitating quick and easy transport.</p>
<p class="indent">His attempts to impose Capitalism from above, instead of building it from below, over a primitive agrarian and guild economy suffered from serious limitations. The industrial sector was on the whole running at a loss. The ruin was completed in 1842, when, as part of settlement of the Syrian War, the British government forced the Pasha to accept the application to Egypt of the Anglo-Ottoman Commercial Treaty of 1838, by which, British merchants were to trade in the country. A few years later, all that remained was a large quantity of rusted machinery all over the country. The managers of the factories were for the most part salaried government officials, ignorant and unenthusiastic about their work. The machines that were imported <a id="calibre_link-386" class="calibre10"></a>were novelties and highly expensive and very few in Egypt had mastered the new technology. The conditions of workers were unenviable; unskilled people were conscripted forcibly to work in factories and paid low wages. They lived in barracks and were kept like soldiers.</p>
<p class="indent">Likewise, attempts to accelerate agriculture production were in no way beneficial to the farmers. Low prices which were paid to them denied any incentive to work hard. Many, in fact, deserted their farms. The only effect of the monopoly system was to keep down the standard of living of the farmers and to divert into the hands of the government the additional wealth created by increased production and higher prices. Both the peasant and the artisan were unable to bear the burden of modernisation resulting in a number of uprisings.</p>
<p class="indent">Though Ali had control of internal politics, he could not go against the foreign powers. The Europeans were granted freedom from all duties and also extraterritoriality (i.e., they could be tried by their own courts). Besides, tariff was decided by the Ottoman Emperor and the Europeans, but not by Egypt separately. England was gradually acquiring commercial predominance over Egypt. The terms imposed by the British in 1842 after the Syrian War makes this point very clear. The new landlord class which acquired a large part of the commercial surplus was export oriented. Eventually, it resulted in direct European free trade colonialism. Egyptian industries were deprived of tariff protection. From 1841&ndash;-42, there was active beginning of a process of the integration of the Egyptian economy to international market in a subservient manner.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet the fact remains that Ali could achieve what must have looked impossible 50 years before the lifting of Egypt out of the morass in which centuries of misrule were smothering her. He increased the agricultural production, though at the cost of lowering the natural fertility of the soil. Further, he introduced elements of Western education and culture in Egypt. Most importantly, he left the country free from any debt, which his successors failed to do.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Condition Under Other Pashas?</b></i></span> Ali’s immediate successor was Abbas Pasha (1849&ndash;54) whose rule is not significant since he was basically a conservative. His two successors, Said Pasha and Ismail Pasha, introduced a number of social, political and economic reforms which resulted in further modernisation of the Egyptian economy.</p>
<p class="indent">Said Pasha (1854&ndash;63), starting with the army, pressurised the Turkish Sultan to increase its strength. A large number of <i class="calibre8">felaheen</i> were recruited for this purpose. The Officers ranks, which comprised Mohammed Ali’s men earlier (Albanians), were now becoming purely Egyptian in composition.</p>
<p class="indent">In the agrarian sector, he first removed the restrictions on private ownership of land and granted the rights of sale, mortgage and transfer to the landlords. Land revenue began to be collected in cash and not in kind and revenue settlement was made with the peasants and not the village heads. He also abolished the last survivals of the monopoly system. The peasant, thus, got freedom to sell his crop freely. A new class of landlords was created who introduced cash crops and machinery in agriculture. Irrigation system was developed further, old canals were remodeled and new ones were dug.</p>
<p class="indent">In the commercial sector, he abolished internal duties in order to introduce free trade inside Egypt also, and to neutralise the advantages enjoyed by the Europeans because of their exemption from internal duties and tariffs. However, these efforts of Said Pasha had serious limitations due to the restrictions imposed on Egypt by the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1842, and hence indigenous products could not naturally compete with foreign goods.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-387" class="calibre10"></a>To improve transport and communications, railway lines connecting different parts of Egypt with Alexandria and the Suez were constructed. In fact Egypt outstripped even France in this. It came to outstrip France in telegraph as well. Great care was given to the development of the Egyptian fleet which became two-and-half times larger than that of France. Roads, bridges, canals and harbours were also improved.</p>
<p class="indent">The most noteworthy development of his reign was the construction of the Suez Canal. Ali was, in fact, the first to moot the idea of a two-sea canal, but dropped it when he felt that it would drag Egypt into international troubles and fierce rivalries. His two successors looked at it with positive but benign eyes. They regarded it as a means of slicing Egypt off the Turkish Empire. Proposal came from French experts like Lambert and Lesseps. In 1854, Said gave concessions to these French engineers. All land and four-fifths of the labour were given free of cost. Its construction had a number of consequences, some positive and some negative. It led to an increase in the strategic, economic, diplomatic and bargaining powers of Egypt. It also led to the birth of two large cities and a province in the Sinai desert. It even brought large sums in taxation. Finally, it meant a technological revolution because of the use of the latest technology. But it dragged Egypt into a huge debt and international rivalries and troubles.</p>
<p class="indent">Said Pasha, was, thus, found lacking the discretion, the judgment and the basic financial soundness of Mohammad Ali. When Said died in 1863, he left a huge debt of 12 million &ndash; composed of his obligations to the Suez Canal Company for his 44% share of the capital issues, public works of various kinds, personal loans, etc. Thus, he was responsible for dragging Egypt into the tentacles of European finance imperialism, though unintentionally.</p>
<p class="indent">Said Pasha (1863&ndash;79) ascended the throne at the height of American Civil War when the interruption of the supply of American cotton to Lancashire led to a tremendous boom in Egyptian cotton. This prosperity led him into impractical dreams of expanding and modernising his country’s economy, for which he would have to depend heavily on foreign finances.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to realise his ambitious plans, he raised the first foreign loan of 5.7 million from a British banking house in 1864. When an outbreak of cattle disease swept Egypt between 1863 and 1865, in order to restore the herds and also to carry out a plan for extending railway, he took another loan in 1866. In his attempt to redress the economic situation by encouraging the planting and processing of sugar on a large scale, he took another loan.</p>
<p class="indent">Due to this extravagant expenditure on such enterprises as railways, irrigation canals, European type schools, harbours, bridges, army and interest payments on the loans (which never amounted to less than 20% per annum on the principal), expenditure during his reign amounted to double the total revenue.</p>
<p class="indent">The mounting foreign debt proved highly detrimental to Egypt. In desperation, Ismail decided to dispose of his 44% share in the capital of the Suez Canal Company. Disraeli (PM of Britain) purchased these shares for the British. Even then the state was bankrupt by 1876.</p>
<p class="indent">Eventually, an international ‘Caise Dela Detta Publique’ was set up with British and French Commissioners to receive Egyptian revenues, to supervise railways and the port of Alexandria, and to maintain the payment due to creditors. In short, ‘dual control’ of Britain and France had begun to regulate the public life in Egypt. A British officer was appointed as General Controller of revenues and a French Officer to control expenditure.</p>
<p class="indent">One more consequence of this increasing debt and the subsequent developments was the rising national feeling among Egyptians. The <a id="calibre_link-388" class="calibre10"></a>European penetration in the previous 50 years and the inauguration of a system of education along European lines had created a class of young men, who had imbibed some of the liberal and nationalist ideas of contemporary Europe. Moreover, while Ismail’s public work schemes had greatly improved Egypt’s communication, transport, production and trade, they had brought little benefit to the masses that bore the main burden of heavy taxation. Hence, a strong under-current of popular discontent was there.</p>
<p class="indent">Ismail was the first of his dynasty to be superficially Europeanised in education and taste. To install in Egypt all the external evidences of European material civilisation, regardless of the cost, was for him to be in the forefront of progress. He embarked upon vast and costly schemes with no adequate study of their practicability. Thus, under Ismail, Egypt was put firmly in the clutches of foreign imperialism and was transformed into a semi-colony of the Europeans.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was it Colonised in Economic Terms?</b></i></span> The geographical location of Egypt made her a prospective area for the operations of Greek, Roman, Turkish and later French and British exploiters for the past 2000 years. It became a province and art gallery of the Greek empire, a granary of the Roman Empire and a gold mine for the Turkish Empire. In fact, at the time of its national awakening, it had no national history, literature or even a language. Then came Mohammad Ali, who is considered as the maker of modern Egypt.</p>
<p class="indent">The basics of colonialism existed even in Ali’s time which was to manifest itself only under his successors. The foreign traders had been freed from all duties and given extra-territorial rights. This gradually enabled the peaceful penetration of Egypt by the foreign powers. By the Anglo-Turkish Treaty (1842), the British goods got free access in Egypt. From the 1840s, began the process of active integration of the Egyptian economy to the European one, in a subordinate way. His great achievement was that there was no foreign debt left behind by him.</p>
<p class="indent">Under Said and Ismail Pasha, Egypt became a target of European imperialism. Like Turkey, Algeria, Morocco, and Persia, Egypt also went through the stages of Europeanisation &ndash; first reconstruction, then corruption and extravagance, followed by foreign financial and political control which is the essence of economic colonisation. The Suez Canal was of immense use to the world, but it proved detrimental to Egypt. It made her the centre of international intrigues and power politics.</p>
<p class="indent">Under Ismail Pasha, the process of economic colonisation of Egypt, which had already begun in some ways, manifested itself in its proper form. He tried to bring to Egypt a costly program of public works and drove the country into bankruptcy. In 1875, he was compelled to sell his shares in the Suez Canal (worth 16 million) to Great Britain which bought it for just 4 million. In April 1876, the Egyptian government suspended payment of its treasury bills and declared itself bankrupt. Consequently, an international ‘Caise De La Detta Publique’ was set up with British and French commissioners to receive Egyptian revenues, to supervise the railways and the port of Alexandria, and to maintain the payments due to the creditors. In short, the dual control of France and Britain over Egypt had begun. Pasha had to give up his important sources of revenue for interest payments. In this way, an indirect official control over Egypt by the European powers began.</p>
<p class="indent">This control was increased further in 1878 with the Pasha giving up all control over administration. The Pasha was now asked to rule through a cabinet containing a British Minister of Finance and a French Minister of Public Works. Among other measures for reducing expenditure, the new cabinet ordered a drastic reduction in the size of the army. 2000 officers were placed on half pay without settlement of their year-long arrears of pay. This caused great indignation and in 1879 the officers forced the government to resign. The British and the French controllers suspected that this demonstration had been instigated by Ismail Pasha himself. Accordingly, the European powers replaced him by his more amenable son, Tawfiq. It is significant to note that in 1879, foreign debt of Egypt was <span>₤</span>500 million, whereas the annual revenue was merely <span>₤</span>40 millions.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-389" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00066.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-390" class="calibre10"></a>Under Tawfiq (1879−92), there was the initial restoration of the Dual Control with greater power, but later, it was altogether abolished with the British occupation of Egypt (1882). The financial policy of two European powers was extremely callous so that no sacrifice should be demanded from the creditors till every possible sacrifice had been made by the debtors. In 1880, the law of liquidation was introduced. The law provided that the annual revenue of Egypt was to be divided into two equal parts, one of which was to be assigned to the Caise De La Detta Publique for the payment of interest to the creditors.</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, nationalist resentment against the foreign powers was growing. In 1881, a military demonstration led by Arabi compelled the Pasha to accept a nationalist government. The Chamber of Notables (Upper House) had the tenacity to claim the right to vote budget without needing the representation of foreign financial controllers. Plans were made to expand the army and place effective control in the hands of native Egyptian officers. The French and the British reacted immediately and the nationalist government was dismissed. Despite some resistance, the British forces captured Cairo. The French, however, abstained, and this was mainly due to her government’s indecision. The British abolished the dual control (which naturally caused resentment on the part of the French) and decided to continue the occupation of Egypt.</p>
<p class="indent">It was Lord Cromer (1882&ndash;1906) who was the <i class="calibre8">de facto</i> ruler of Egypt for the next 24 years. By the Convention of London (1885), an international loan was arranged for Egypt with the addition of Germany and Russia to the membership of Caise La Detta Publique. British advisers were attached to various ministers and they were always more powerful than the ministers. Tawfiq raised no objection to these measures and Cromer went on increasing his control over the administration.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir Gorst, Cromer’s successor, granted greater freedom of action to the Egyptian government, and even his successor, Lord Kitchener, made efforts at achieving political tranquility. With the coming of World War I and the declaration of martial law in Egypt, the whole political question was suspended. Even after the achievement of freedom by Egypt in the 1920s, the British continued to exercise some sort of indirect control over Egypt till 1946.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-50"><b class="calibre9">SEMI-COLONIALISM IN CHINA</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Chinese civilisation was a unique and self-contained one which developed over a long period spanning 4000 years. It was essentially an agrarian economy rather than one based on trade, and like most other Asian societies, it was governed by landlords and bureaucrats rather than by merchants and politicians. Having grown and developed in such isolation, Chinese society was distinctly self-centred and self-assured regarding the rest of the world as inferior.</p>
<p class="indent">China’s first contact with the West came when the Portuguese appeared on its Southeast coast in 1514. The Portuguese were followed by the British and the Dutch. There were over-land visitors too&mdash;Russians came in from the North and the Amur village. In a characteristically Chinese manner, all these visitors were kept at arms length and relations with them restricted to trade at a few ports. Diplomatic relations on a full and equal basis were rejected.</p>
<p class="indent">But this isolation was not possible for long. China received a severe jolt from three disastrous wars: the first with Britain in <a id="calibre_link-391" class="calibre10"></a>1840&ndash;42; the second with Britain and France in 1856&ndash;58; and the third with Japan in 1895. The humiliation China suffered in these wars forced it to throw open its gates to the West, end its condescending attitude toward the rest of the world and reappraise their own civilisation. The result was the beginning of a process of interaction and reaction that led to the growth of a new China with far reaching consequences on the Far East and the entire world.</p>
<p class="indent">It was rather easy for Britain to take lead in opening up China because it had already consolidated a power base in India and controlled the seas. Britain’s main objective was to remove the obstacles that the Chinese had placed in the way of trading operations. Hostilities between Britain and China were triggered by the issue of opium trade.</p>
<p class="indent">European soldiers had introduced opium smoking in China in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and the habit soon spread rapidly into the hinterland. The demand for opium solved the British problem of paying for Chinese goods. Before this the British had been forced to pay mainly in gold and silver because the Chinese had little interest in the western goods. With the demand for opium growing, the balance of trade was reversed in favour of the British. The Peking government issued decrees in 1729 and 1799 prohibiting the import of opium but the trade was so profitable that Chinese officials could be bribed to permit smuggling.</p>
<p class="indent">The first Anglo-Chinese war, or the Opium War as it is known, broke out when the Chinese tried to enforce their prohibition of the opium traffic. The war began in 1840 and during the hostilities that followed China’s military inferiority became obvious. With just a squadron of ships and a few thousand men the English were able to seize port after port at will. This was because Chinese military technology had stagnated, while European warships and artillery improved at an amazing pace between the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries. Faced with such a desperate situation the Peking government capitulated and accepted the Treaty of Nanking, the first of a series of unequal treaties that were to nibble away much of China’s sovereignty.</p>
<p class="indent">The Nanking Treaty did not end the friction between the Chinese and the Europeans. The latter pressed for more and more concessions so as to increase trade, while the Chinese felt that too many privileges had been granted. With this simmering dissatisfaction it was no surprise that war began again in 1856. This time, the occasion was the imprisonment by Chinese officials of the Chinese crew of a Chinese ship flying the British flag. When Peking refused to release the crew, the British bombarded Canton. Using the murder of a French priest as a pretext, France too entered the war. The combined forces of England and France proved invincible and, in June 1858, the Chinese were forced to sign the Tientsin Treaties. However, they refused to adhere to the provisions of the treaties, leading to a renewed attack by the Anglo-French forces. This time the capital was captured and China was forced to sign the Peking Convention in 1860. The Tientsin and Peking Agreements opened several more ports on the coast. In the interior, they redefined and extended extraterritoriality and permitted the establishment of foreign legations in Peking and Christian missions throughout the country.</p>
<p class="indent">The third and most humiliating defeat was suffered by China at the hands of its small neighbouring kingdom of Japan. Unlike the Chinese, the Japanese had made use of Western technology to suit their own needs. Japanese achieved what no other oriental state had been able to. Japan began to press home certain shadowy claims in Korea. Traditionally, the Koreans had recognised the suzerainty of China, but they had also paid tributes to Japan periodically. Thus, when China sent a small force to Korea in response to an appeal for aid to crush a revolt, the Japanese also landed a detachment of marines. The two forces clashed, <a id="calibre_link-392" class="calibre10"></a>and war was formally declared in August 1894. The Chinese armies were easily routed and in April 1895, Peking was forced to accept the Treaty of Shimonoseki.</p>
<p class="indent">The defeat at the hands of a small neighbouring kingdom was a shattering blow to the pride and complacency of China. The great empire had been shown to be completely helpless at the hands of a despised neighbour equipped with modern equipment. Furthermore, the European powers were taking advantage of Chinese weakness and annexing outlying territories that traditionally had recognised the suzerainty of Peking. France seized Indo-china, Britain took Burma, and Japan, since it had established its predominance in Korea, proceeded to annex the country outright. Russia took the Amur Valley, the Maritime Provinces, and for a while occupied the Li River region in Central Asia. The Western powers did not, however, stop with territorial acquisitions. They were soon dividing up China proper amongst themselves. They set up ‘spheres of influence’ in which the political and economic primacy of each respective power was recognised. Thus, Yunan and the area bordering on Indo-china became a French sphere, Canton and the Yangtze valley and the large area in between was a British sphere. Manchuria was Russian, Shantung was German and Fukien Japanese.</p>
<p class="indent">The series of humiliating defeats China experienced in the latter half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century forced the traditionally self-centred Middle Kingdom to undertake a painful self-assessment and reorganisation. The Chinese slowly and gradually tried to follow the Western model in a number of fields&mdash;first in the military, then in the economic and later in the social, intellectual and political fields as well.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What Were the Relations Till Opium Wars?</b></i></span> China did not open her door to the Europeans on her own. The West initially enticed her and then compelled her to let them in. Of the Europeans, the Portuguese were the first to arrive in China, followed by the Spanish, the Dutch, the English and French. The Portuguese, having the head start, succeeded in establishing themselves at Macao in 1557 from where they exercised a virtual monopoly of the China trade throughout 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries. The Spanish and the Dutch, however, could never strike their roots in China. The English, who first sent an expedition to China in 1635, showed better enterprise and in the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century became the leaders of Europeans in the Far Eastern trade.</p>
<p class="indent">All the Europeans came to the Southern coast of China and established contacts with the Chinese Empire through Canton. The ‘pearl delta’ is formed by the merger of three rivers near the port city of Canton. These rivers provide a fine inland network of communications for the port of Canton. An imperial edict of 1635 allowed foreigners to trade at all coastal ports. Canton, with its favourable position, attracted the Western traders more than any other port. Hence they concentrated mainly at Canton.</p>
<p class="indent">What was regarded as an advantage initially was made a necessity after 1757. In that year, to keep the ‘Western Barbarians’ at arms length the Chinese Emperor made Canton the sole open port. From 1757 up to the end of the first “Opium War”, Canton was known as ‘Canton Trade’ and kept under strict vigil. In order to keep the foreign merchants segregated even at Canton they were confined to a small area, the Macao. The Chinese authorities could not be wholly blamed for the restrictions they imposed on the western merchants. They were witnesses to a number of petty quarrels that occurred during the Napoleonic Wars among the British, the American and the Spanish in Chinese waters. The Chinese government, being in the imperialist activities of the EICO in India, would naturally attempt to prevent Canton from becoming another Calcutta.</p>
<p class="indent">The name ‘Opium Wars’ is misleading because England fought these wars against <a id="calibre_link-393" class="calibre10"></a>China for achieving an object of much greater interest than the protection of the opium trade. She aimed at acquiring a political footing and extra-territorial rights, the prerequisites for establishing a solid colonial economy. Or else she would not have demanded these things in the subsequent treaties. Interestingly the treaty of Nanking, signed after the first war, made no mention of the opium trade. Yet, these wars got that name just because the protection of opium trade was one of the immediate interests of the British, though not the most important one.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Causes for the First War?</b></i></span> The Chinese who always regarded themselves to be immensely superior to the ‘barbarians’ from the West, treated them with disdain and denied <a id="calibre_link-394" class="calibre10"></a>them the right to equality in official relations. This is clear from the fact that the Chinese treated the ambassadors of foreign powers as tribute bearers, and hence insisted that they should ‘<i class="calibre8">kow-tow</i>’ (prostrate nine times) before the Chinese Emperor or his picture.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00093.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">The ‘<i class="calibre8">Co-hang</i>’ (a group of Chinese merchants) enjoying monopoly controlled all the foreign trade in China. The foreign merchants had to conduct all their transactions in China through these merchants. These Chinese merchants used to abuse their privileges and exploit the foreign merchants. The foreign merchants resented it and were eager to put an end to the system.</p>
<p class="indent">The new British merchants, who entered the China trade after the abolition of the monopoly of the East India Company in 1833, were in a hurry to find new markets and wanted the Chinese government to recognise the principle of free trade and equal opportunity. But, as the Chinese were unwilling to concede any fresh concessions, the British merchants both at Canton and at home, prevailed upon their government to exert pressure with adequate military support on the Peking government. Consequently, in 1828, Lord Palmerstone dispatched a small British naval squadron to the coastal waters of China to support the complaints of British merchants. After this, war seemed imminent.</p>
<p class="indent">Another source of dispute was the universal complaint of the foreign merchants regarding the tariff irregularities. Though the Chinese imperial government set moderate tariff schedules, the officials usually overlooked them and collected high duties from the foreign merchants. Some of the duties were as high as 10 times the original rates.</p>
<p class="indent">The application of the Chinese law of ‘<i class="calibre8">talion</i>’, or ‘an eye for an eye’, to the foreign merchants was an eye-sore for them. Crimes among foreigners were often left to their own jurisdiction. In cases where any Chinese subject became involved, the Chinese law was enforced which included torture to extract confession and group responsibility that made any crew member chargeable for his shipmate’s offences.</p>
<p class="indent">As the name suggests, the opium question also played an important role. Opium trade brought immense profit to the colonial government of British India, the East India Company, the British capitalists, and, in an indirect way, to the British government itself. Huge quantities of opium were exported from India and the customs’ duties on it became a chief source of the revenue of the British India Government. British merchants who smuggled opium into China made huge profits. Due to the thriving opium trade, British capitalists at home could export large quantity of finished cotton goods and import large quantity of tea. This resulted in huge profits for them. On the other hand, customs duty on the imported tea formed a major source of British Government’s revenue.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the large-scale smuggling of opium into China resulted in massive drain of silver from the country. Hence silver became scarce and its value appreciated in terms of copper. Silver and copper coins were the two currencies then in use in China. Peasants and handicraftsmen got the prices of their product in terms of copper cash while they were obliged to pay their taxes in silver. So the lowering of the prices of copper in terms of silver caused great hardship to them. The silver drain reduced government tax collection as well and the Manchu government faced grave financial crisis. Besides, opium was telling heavily upon the moral standards of the country. Practically, almost all the state officials were addicted to the vice and as a consequence there was prevalence of corruption everywhere. Alarmed by the declining moral standards, the court attempted to suppress the opium trade.</p>
<p class="indent">When the matter seemed to go out of hand, the Chinese government appointed <a id="calibre_link-395" class="calibre10"></a>Lin-Tse-Hsu, an honest and able officer, as special opium commissioner to suppress the illegal trade altogether. Lin’s strong measure of the seizure and destruction of 20,000 chests of opium, though resented, did not evoke protest from Elliot, the British Superintendent of Trade. Lin’s demand that the British merchants must give bond on penalty of death that they would not import opium any more was not complied with and Elliot advised the British merchants not to give such a bond. This naturally brought the Anglo-Chinese relations to a crisis point.</p>
<p class="indent">The English merchants, threatened and pressed by Chinese, retired from Canton to Macro. At this point occurred an incident known as ‘Kowloon Incident’, the killing of a Chinese villager by English sailors, which is said to be the immediate cause of the war. This death highlighted the conflicting problem of jurisdiction, and Lin, after a month of indecision, passed an order to the effect that the culprit as well as those who protected him should be boycotted. He further ordered that all supplies should be cut off for the English.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How Did it Take Place?</b></i></span> The British Parliament in April 1840 decided to wage war against China apparently to redress the grievances of the English merchants there. The First Opium or Anglo-Chinese War which resulted from this may be seen in three phases: from April 1840 to January 1841 (first truce); from February 1841 to May 1841 (second truce); and from June 1841 to August 1842 (Treaty of Nanking). Initially the operations were confined to Canton and its vicinity, but when the English carried the operation further up the coast and the British vessels proceeded a short distance up the Yangtse, cutting the eastern part of the Empire in two, the war was finally brought to an end.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Results?</b></i></span> Peking, now realising the gravity of the conflict, desired peace and the treaty of Nanking was signed on August 29, 1842. Some of the articles of this most humiliating treaty deserve special mention:</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(1)</span>China ceded Hong Kong to England and agreed to open five ports to European trade and commence, viz., Canton, Foochow, Ningpo, Amoy and Shanghai. These were called ‘Treaty Ports’. It was also stipulated that the British merchants would be allowed to carry on trade without molestation. The British merchants were also allowed to reside in the five ports with their families.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(2)</span>It was also settled that ‘fair and regular’ tariffs on imports and exports would be published in order to avoid the arbitrary fixing of dues by local officials.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(3)</span>China had to recognise the principle of equality of all nations in international relations and to treat British officials as the equal to Chinese officials of the same rank. The practice of ‘<i class="calibre8">kow-tow</i>’ was abolished.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(4)</span>China was asked to pay a large war indemnity (12 million dollars) as she was declared guilty. She had also to pay 9 million dollars as settlement of debts due to British merchants from the <i class="calibre8">Co-hang</i> merchants. Thus, altogether the Chinese had to pay 21 million dollars.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(5)</span>Monopoly rights given to the Chinese merchants, that are ‘<i class="calibre8">Co-hang</i>’, were withdrawn.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(6)</span>The British, in turn, promised to cooperate in suppressing contraband goods, including opium.</p>
<p class="indent">In the following year, China was compelled to conclude another treaty with England, viz. the Treaty of Bogue by which China ceded extra-territorial rights and most favoured nation clause to the British. Soon other separate treaties were signed by the Chinese with the other European powers such as the USA, France, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, etc., conceding similar concessions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-396" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Treaty Port System?</b></i></span> The opening of the five ports which were called ‘Treaty Ports’ to European trade and commerce started the ‘Treaty Port System’. The treaty port system was a system in which the European nations were allowed to trade with China through specified ports. It was through this system that the Europeans sought and succeeded in opening up China to European trade and commerce. Some more ports were later added to this list and they came to play an important role in commercial relations between China and the European nations. Thus, began the foreign penetration of China by the West. The Treaty of Nanking was also the first of many unequal treaties which were later imposed on China in the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and early 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century by the European powers and Japan. It also marked the beginning of forcible infringement of China’s sovereignty, and its transition from a traditional, self-contained and independent feudal society to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What Led to the Second War?</b></i></span> The Nanking Treaty and the following ones did not, however, result in the complete opening up of the China to the Europeans. While the foreigners went on demanding more privileges, the Chinese viewed the increase of foreign intercourse with growing disdain. These difference of attitude aroused passions that led to a fresh showdown in the form of the second Anglo-Chinese War or the second Opium War (1856&ndash;58).</p>
<p class="indent">The Europeans in general and the British in particular were not happy with the working of the Treaty of Nanking. They hoped that the treaty would remove the last hurdles to a limitless market in China. But instead they realised that British exports to China in the following decade had registered a decline rather than an increase. One explanation for this decline was that China’s available supply of silver as well as that of silk and tea, two of her most important exportable commodities, were virtually depleted to pay for the huge amounts of opium smuggled into the country. Consequently, she was not in a position to buy much of the manufactures of England. Further, the internal tariffs of China did not come under the scope of the treaties signed. The British capitalists were very keen on getting these restrictions removed so that their goods could easily enter into the huge internal Chinese market. They exerted pressure on the British government to open China fully so that they could freely exploit the country.</p>
<p class="indent">The Chinese, on the other hand, were smarting under the latest humiliations. They were fully justified in being unhappy and felt agitated on the continuance of the illegal trade in opium. They were also aggrieved at the so called ‘pig trade’, i.e., sending Chinese labourers abroad by the agents. These emigrants were mostly ill-treated by the agents. The existence of piracy on the South China Sea in which the Portuguese also had a hand gave rise to many problems.</p>
<p class="indent">The failure of the foreigners to overcome their commercial problems, demand of the Western merchants and the Christian missionaries of the right to travel freely in the interior and to spread Christianity with a legal guarantee of tolerance to the converts, their insistence for the right of adequate representation with the Chinese government, etc., were other contributory factors to the war.</p>
<p class="indent">In such a tense atmosphere, minor incidents could easily lead to a fresh conflict. The immediate cause of the war was the ‘Lorcha Arrow’ incident. In 1856, matters were brought to a boiling point by the capture of ‘Lorcha Arrow’ which was a Chinese-owned but Hong Kong registered vessel on the ground that it was engaged in contraband trade. The British government took the incident as an insult to British sovereignty and the British nation and demanded full reparation. The Chinese viceroy of Canton out rightly rejected the British suggestion. This started the second Opium War.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-397" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Take Place?</b></i></span> Soon the French also joined in the war against China for her own reasons. During the Canton trouble of 1856&ndash;57, the French had a grievance against the Chinese government on account of the judicial murder of a French catholic missionary, Abbe Chapdelaine. He had infiltrated into the interiors of China without the knowledge of the Chinese authority: while he was initially welcomed, later he was captured and murdered at the direction of a Chinese magistrate. Failing to get reparation, the French joined hands with the English in the second bombardment and occupation of Canton.</p>
<p class="indent">China was finally forced in 1858 to ask for peace due to the success of the British and French arms on land and sea. Taking advantage of defeat, other European countries jumped on to the bandwagon and demanded the same concessions as was going to give to the British and the French. In June 1858, China signed four separate treaties, which are known as ‘Treaties of Tientsin’, with Britain, France, the USA and Russia.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were its Results?</b></i></span> Some of the provisions of the British Treaty of Tientsin are very important:</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(1)</span>China agreed to open 10 more ports.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(2)</span>Right to maintain a British Resident Minister in the court of Peking.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(3)</span>Guarantee of toleration to Christianity in China. This clause gave the British merchants as well as missionaries to preach their doctrine in the Celestial Empire without any obstacle.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(4)</span>Provision was made for revision, largely in the foreign interests, of the tariff schedules. It was a serious infringement of China’s sovereignty. She lost her right of regulating her own fiscal matters and was no more in a position to protect her cottage and infant industries, because foreign merchants could import foreign goods without restrictions.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(5)</span>Foreign warships were permitted to enter, anchor in and patrol any port where the merchants were allowed.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(6)</span>China was compelled to legalise opium trade.</p>
<p class="indent">The treaties concluded by other western powers with China were almost of the same nature, though differing in detail. When China showed her unwillingness to permit foreign envoys at Peking, hostilities were renewed and China was forced to agree to intercourse with foreigners on status of equality by the Convention of Peking of 1860.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Impact of Treaty System?</b></i></span> Through the Treaty Port System, which was the result of the so-called Opium Wars, European powers threw open the gates of China to the inroads of European colonialism and imperialism. If the first war started opening of China, the real opening of the country was achieved by the second war. The opening of more Treaty Ports and the rights of navigation in the inland rivers conceded by China, made possible the penetration of western goods and ideas to the remotest parts of the country. The unequal treaties imposed on China not only put an end to her isolation but also relegated her to an inferior status. The weakness of China continued throughout the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and early 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries until China was virtually cut into the so-called spheres of influence of the different imperial powers and she became a semi-colony.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Finance Imperialism?</b></i></span> Finance Imperialism is a phase of the larger economic imperialism, but in China it was the most important phase prior to 1914. In China, it amounted to the establishment of control through finance to further the economic interests of the European states, the USA and Japan. To the Chinese, the process was that of being gradually enfolded in the visible tentacles of an octopus, that is European finance. The most important concrete manifestation of the growing <a id="calibre_link-398" class="calibre10"></a>foreign financial control over China was in the sphere of communications, where the arteries of communication, such as railways, were built with borrowed money and subjected to varying degrees of foreign control. The results of this kind of control were disastrous for the Chinese. For, customs were hypothecated, and salt tax was reorganised and brought under foreign control.</p>
<p class="indent">The establishment of Finance Imperialism in China was facilitated by certain defective features of China’s economy and taxation system. China was for a long time almost completely dependent on foreign capital for development and for meeting the increases in her governmental expenditure which necessarily arose from the imposition of indemnity payment. For developmental purposes, there was no domestic money market, not because of the non-availability of capital in China, but due to lack of confidence in the government as an agency for the construction of railroads and opening of mines &ndash; two great fields for the use of capital.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides, there was inflexible revenue system which could not be changed to meet the increased public expenditure. Any increase in the taxes met with serious resistance. Moreover, China could not, until after 1930, meet her needs by an increase in customs levels, since the rates were fixed by treaties with foreign powers. Therefore, she had to necessarily depend on foreign money market to take care of her immediate needs and provide for the governmental undertakings such as the construction of railways.</p>
<p class="indent">Early European interest in the opening up of the Chinese Empire was a commercial one and England took the lead as the chief trading state. The rights and privileges that were demanded were those considered necessary to enable them to carry on their trade more profitably. Toward the end of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the imperial powers showed an interest in the development of exclusive zones in different parts of the Chinese Empire and this interest, though given an economic expression, was largely political in its nature. As financial interest began to appear, particularly after 1895, the union of finance and diplomacy became very close.</p>
<p class="indent">Desire to promote trade relations was not the most marked feature of the pressures on China. Political ends could be not so readily advanced by the promotion of trade. Consequently, it is to finance that we must turn to estimate the position and policy on the powers.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was it Praticed in China?</b></i></span> The period of Finance Imperialism in China (1895&ndash;1914) can be seen in two phases. The first phase (1895&ndash;1908) was characterised by severe competition among the imperialist powers to advance loans to China so that they could secure exclusive zones of influence in China. In the second phase (1908&ndash;1914), the powers showed an increasing realisation of the disadvantages of an unlimited competition and, as a result, tended to cooperate in the economic and financial exploitation of China.</p>
<p class="indent">Before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894&ndash;1895, China had no significant foreign debt but the war imposed a huge indemnity of 23 crore taels over China by Japan. France and Russia came to the aid of China and offered a loan of 400 million francs the Chinese government to pay the first installment of the indemnity. Though this loan was made by Russia and France jointly, it was almost fully subscribed by France since Russia had no money to lend.</p>
<p class="indent">The British and the Germans were the next on the list to press on the Chinese government a loan to meet the second installment of the indemnity to the tune of 16 million pounds in 1898. The Anglo-German financiers were forced to contend with the Russo-French group, both strongly urging their claims to be considered by the Chinese government. The Anglo-German financiers were successful, although they offered less advantageous terms, because of <a id="calibre_link-399" class="calibre10"></a>the strong pressure brought to bear on China from the British legation. No government guarantee was involved in this loan. It was, nevertheless, the desire to combat the Russian influence which caused the British government to insist that their financiers should have the privilege of helping China out of the difficulties created by the war with Japan. Ultimately both groups reaped an abundant reward for their benevolence when it came to the scramble for economic privileges in China during and after 1898.</p>
<p class="indent">Another huge public debt of China came from the failure of the Boxer Movement; the indemnity imposed amounting to 45 crore taels. The security taken for this was the balance of the wartime customs increased by the raising of the tariff rates to 5%, the revenue from the native customs administered in the open ports by the maritime customs service and the revenue from salt <i class="calibre8">gabelle</i> (tax). Maritime custom was the best security because it was a service efficiently organised and administered under foreign supervision.</p>
<p class="indent">While government loans for paying the indemnities were important, the principal field for foreign finance lay in securing and utilising concessions. It was through railway construction that the powers hoped to effectively penetrate and develop the areas claimed as spheres of influence. Extensive control over these was demanded which shows that the interests were political. The control provisions that were demanded usually consisted of priority in purchase of material; supervision of the construction of the roads; audit and other supervision of expenditure; actual operation of road during the life of the loan; and administration of the railway zone and policy rights therein.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the railroads which provided the control of operation for strategically or other political purposes were the Russian and Japanese lines in Manchuria, German line in Shantung province and French system in Yunan and Kwangsi provinces. They were constructed and for some years operated under the supervision of the foreign governments and not by the government of China. It is quite evident that the loans were not made primarily as good investment nor were the railroads constructed for the sake of the advantages derived from the sale of material to be used in building them or because of the profits that would be made out of their operation. In some cases, it was apparent that the railroads would not be immediately or even for a long time profitable. In addition to specific concessions, government also sought a general monopoly of construction in their respective spheres.</p>
<p class="indent">This resulted in a parcelling of China into spheres of influence. Each power sought to strengthen itself in its sphere by keeping out the others, either by direct agreement or by pressure exerted at Peking to prevent the grant of concessions to other powers.</p>
<p class="indent">Negotiations were initiated again in 1908 between Chinese government and Anglo-American financiers for the financing of a line from Chinchow to Algun. Before securing the ratification of the Chinese government, the US Secretary of State, Knox, made his famous proposal for the neutralisation of the railroads in Manchuria. However, the methods employed to get approval for them were quite objectionable. It was held that before approaching England, Knox should have negotiated with Russia a large loan to China so that she might buy out the Russian and Japanese interests and that the Manchurian railways should be neutralised and internationally administered during the period of the loan. England herself did not respond warmly. While the Japanese and the Russian governments gave a categorical refusal to consider the American proposals, the Chinchow-Aigun concession was allowed to lapse.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-400" class="calibre10"></a>The consequences of this episode were quite far reaching: the right if China to decide upon the cause of railway development within her territory was denied by the foreign nations; certain foreign nations declared that their strategically and political interests must be considered as permanent in planning a railway system within China’s territory; they asserted the right to decide who would finance, construct and operate railways within China.</p>
<p class="indent">The second phase of Finance Imperialism in China (1908&ndash;-14) inaugurated an era of international cooperation in financing China and this can be seen in the Knox proposal itself. The Knox proposal did not materialise, but an undercurrent to usher in the international cooperation in the financial exploitation of China was already making progress. The powers were gradually coming to realise that competition among them had the adverse effect of playing into the hands of China by securing her favourable terms in the making of loans than could otherwise have been obtained. A good instance of this was the railroad from Tientsin by securing the elimination of many of the usual control provisions. In fact the construction and the operation of the road were to be in the hands of China herself.</p>
<p class="indent">The 1911 Revolution resulted in new financial problems for the Chinese government. Once again, it began to look to foreign sources for funds for general administration purposes. The Chinese government turned to the international syndicate (which had been formed in 1910 with Britain, France, Germany and USA as members and which extended to include Japan and Russia in 1912) for advances. The government found that the syndicate insisted on adequate provisions for control of the revenue to be pledged as security. Finally, in 1913, agreement was reached on salt <i class="calibre8">gabelle</i> as the security for the loan and provision was made for its reorganisation under foreign supervision.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were its Results?</b></i></span> China naturally suffered immensely till 1930, because of the evils of Finance Imperialism. The European powers, the USA and Japan carried on an unashamed exploitation of China and its resources. The railroads which were constructed with the finance capital were not meant for improving communications and transport for the benefit of the Chinese but for that of each power to exploit the mineral resources of the areas under their control and to make them protected markets for their manufactured goods. The conditions under which loans were granted were so different and provisions for the supervision of construction so varied that it resulted in a non-uniform gauge. Some roads had the standard gauge, Russian roads used the 5 feet gauge, and the French roads the meter gauge. This naturally stood in the way of efficient administration of roads.</p>
<p class="indent">But after 1930, China could properly utilise the finance capital invested there by the western powers. There was a rapid improvement of trade and commerce. Farmers had incentive to cultivate commercial crops such as soybeans, raw silk, cotton, etc. Western education and ideas spread among the people resulting in the reform movement of 1911. Economic exploitation of China by these imperialist powers naturally resulted in the rise and growth of nationalist and anti-imperialist movement in China. Finance imperialism also resulted in the industrialisation of China which was, however, lopsided and finally it must be concluded that China materiality benefitted by the enlargement and improvement of her means of communication.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Military and Economic Impact of the West on China?</b></i></span> The military superiority of the West was recognised by some Chinese soon after they fought and lost the first British attack. Among those who recognised the British threat was Lin-Tse-Hsu, the commissioner who was appointed by the Emperor to stem the <a id="calibre_link-401" class="calibre10"></a>flow of opium and who led the Chinese in the war. In a letter to a friend he described the impossibility of coping with British warships, but was not willing to make his views public. This aversion to publicity was possibly due to the fear of a hostile reaction from colleagues and superiors. This fear was fully justified. The scholar-officials who ruled China remained, with a few exceptions, profoundly hostile and scornful of everything western. The shock of defeat compelled them to take certain measures towards imitating western arms and techniques. They only went through the motions without doing anything. In reality, even if they had sincerely wanted to imitate the West, which fundamentally they did not, the mandarins were hopelessly incompetent in mechanical matters. Thus, China did little during the inter-war years of 1842&ndash;1858 to face the challenge of European expansion.</p>
<p class="indent">The second defeat at the hands of western powers forced a few forward-looking Chinese intellectuals to reconsider their traditional values and policies. They responded with what was called a ‘self-strengthening’ movement. This was a phrase derived from the Confucian classics and was used in 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century China to mean the preservation of Chinese civilisation by grafting on western mechanisms. To this end, Chinese leaders became willing to go beyond purely military matters to include railroads, steamship line, machine factories, and applied science in general. This self-strengthening movement was, however, doomed to fail because the base premise on which it rested was false. Westernisation could not be a halfway process; it was all or nothing. Westernisation in tools inevitably led to westernisation in ideas and institutions as well. So western science could not be used to preserve a Confusion civilisation; rather it was bound to undermine that civilisation.</p>
<p class="indent">For instance, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established in 1872 to build steamships for transporting rice from the Yantze Delta to the capital in the north. The steamer fleet needed coal, so the Kaiping coal mines were opened north of Tientsin in 1878. To transport this coal, China’s first permanent rail road began operations in 1881. This integrated complex of enterprises had a sound economic basis and should have prospered. Its directors were motivated in the traditional Chinese fashion more by family than by corporate considerations. They appointed needy relatives and greedy henchmen to various posts, with the result that the entire undertaking fell heavily into debt and eventually passed into foreign control.</p>
<p class="indent">China’s failure to build up its economy and its armed forces led inevitably to increasing western control. Numerous loans were made to the Peking government often under pressure and on conditions that gave the creditors control over China’s economy in stages. Another means of economic influence were the concessions in various Chinese ports that were held by the European powers. Most important was the International Settlement of Shanghai which developed into a sovereign European city state where Chinese laws did not apply and Chinese police and courts had no jurisdiction. These concessions profoundly affected China’s economy, which traditionally has been self-sufficient and land-based, but which was now becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign controlled coastal cities, especially on Shanghai. The western powers also dominated the great inland waterways as well as coastal ports. They maintained fleets of gunboats that patrolled the Yangtze River between Shanghai and Chunking, a distance of 1500 miles across the heart of China.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Social Impact of the West on China?</b></i></span> The Chinese response to the challenge from the West broadened in the late 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and early 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century from the military and economic spheres to the social sphere. This was due to the fact that the extension of foreign business into the interior of the country stimulated the <a id="calibre_link-402" class="calibre10"></a>growth of a Chinese merchant class which soon took over the distribution of western goods. Later Chinese manufacturers began to establish match factories, flour and cotton mills, silk spinning factories. These new economic leaders tended to be an independent political force. They disliked European domination because of the reactionary imperial court in Peking which neither offered effective resistance to the foreigners nor showed any understanding of the nature and needs of a modern economy. As a result, the Chinese merchants felt no more loyalty towards the Manchu regime in Peking than the Indian merchants had earlier felt for the Mughal regime in Delhi. Thus, it was they who provided the real force behind the revolutionary nationalist movement that developed in the late 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The first anti-foreign boycotts being organised in the coastal cities and the organisation of the 1911 revolution that overthrew the Manchu dynasty in the very same places was no accident of fate.</p>
<p class="indent">The unstable conditions prevailing in China affected the ruling scholar-bureaucrats too, though they were pushed in the direction of reform rather revolution. The official positions they held made them speak of change within tradition rather than of any radical changes. They continued to hold the view that the Confucian civilisation could be renovated to meet modern needs. The most influential exponent of this view was a Cantonese scholar called Kang Yu-wei (1858&ndash;1927), who startled his contemporaries by his study, ‘<i class="calibre8">Confucius as a Reformer</i>’. This iconoclastic work depicted Confucius as a champion of the rights of the people rather than of imperial authority.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea of people’s rights and their participation in government was something new for China. Before the arrival of the westerners the concepts of democracy and nationalism had been conspicuously absent. The emphasis was on family and so far as a broader allegiance was concerned, it took the form of ‘culturalism’ rather them nationalism. Culturalism meant identification with the native cultural tradition which was viewed simply as the alternative to foreign barbarism. China’s scholar-bureaucrats were steeped in this tradition. In contrast to this, however, the reform leaders now accepted revolutionary western concepts.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Political Impact of the West on China?</b></i></span> The reform leaders gained support in their country following defeat at the hands of the Japanese in 1895. They managed to get the attention of the young emperor Kuang-hsu, who for a brief spell broke away from the influence of the empress dowager, Tzu-hsi. The latter had determined China’s policy since 1860, but now the reformers won the emperor to their side. Impressed by their oral and written presentations in the summer of 1898, he issued a series of sweeping reform decrees&mdash;collectively called the ‘Hundred Days Reform’. Numerous sinecures were to be eliminated; the provincial governments were to be more centralised under Peking; new schools were to disseminate European learning. Western style production methods were to be encouraged and a national conscript army was to be organised along western lines. But these measures never went beyond the paper. The empress, with the support of the military, deposed the emperor, declared herself regent, rescinded all the decrees and executed six of the reform leaders.</p>
<p class="indent">With the collapse of the short-lived reform movement, the reactionaries got full power. In their renewed zeal, they channeled social and political discontent against the foreigners. Anti-foreign secret societies incited by court reactionaries and provincial governors organised local militants to combat foreign aggression. Chief among such societies was the ‘I-Ho-Tuan’ or ‘Righteous Harmony Fists’, called Boxers. With official connivance, the Boxers began to attack foreigners and by 1900, several foreigners and Chinese Christians <a id="calibre_link-403" class="calibre10"></a>were killed in North China. When European naval detachments began landing at Tientsin, the Boxers declared war on all foreigners and besieged legations in Peking. International armies, however, relieved the legations in a few months and the imperial court fled from the capital. China once again had to accept peace under humiliating terms, including further commercial concessions and payment of an indemnity of $333 millions.</p>
<p class="indent">The failure of the Hundred Days Reform and the Boxer Rebellion made it clear that modernising China from above, was a revolution from below, and this did take place in 1911 when the Manchu dynasty was overthrown and a republic took its place.</p>

<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Liberalism was one of the great European doctrines to affect the world. Its central feature is the emancipation of the individual from class, corporate or governmental restraint. Liberalism and the rise of the middle class were closely related and it has remained essentially a middle class movement in its theory and source of support.</p>
<p class="indent">Liberalism developed in its classic form in Western Europe. The Liberal doctrines were clearly formulated and implemented for the first time during the English Revolution. These doctrines were primarily those of religious tolerance and security of person and property against the arbitrariness of the crown. The implementation of these doctrines involved the existence of independent political parties, parliamentary control of government and the recognition of the need for and the rights of opposition parties. However, there were certain limitations too. The franchise was limited by property qualifications, so that the lower, middle class and the workers who made up the majority, were left without votes. Thus, in 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century England, liberalism served to advance middle class interest.</p>
<p class="indent">Liberalism got a more definite shape as the American Revolution brought about substantial advances in restricting slavery, extending religious tolerance, broadening franchise, and establishing constitutional government. Like the English settlement, the US Constitution, too, carefully protected the interests of the propertied class by limiting franchise by providing indirect election of the president and the senators for the election of the various branches of the government for different periods of time. These were part of a system of checks and <a id="calibre_link-407" class="calibre10"></a>balances designed to prevent a radical popular movement from getting control of the entire government at any one time constitutionally and introducing dangerous changes.</p>
<p class="indent">The French revolution which followed further advanced the principle of liberalism. Its ‘Declaration of Rights’ of Man is the classic statement of 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century liberalism, proclaiming the liberties of the individual. French liberalism was a bourgeois movement. The Declaration and several other constitutions adopted by the French revolutionaries laid stress on the inviolable and sacred rights of property. Napoleon too in his famous codes, which proved to be the most durable and influential, forbade the formation of trade unions and the waging of strikes.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the liberalism that emerged from the English, American and French Revolutions took the institutional form of constitutional parliamentary government and stressed on equal civil rights, though not on political and social rights.</p>
<p class="indent">Like all historical movements, liberalism underwent an appreciable change in character as the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century came to an end. At a time when the masses were gradually beginning to assert themselves more and more as a result of increasing education and trade union organisation, liberalism could not continue to concern itself with bourgeois interests alone. As a result, focus changed from the early, classical liberalism to a more democratic type. Equality before the law was replaced by equality before the ballot box. By the end of 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century universal suffrage for men had been adopted in most countries in Western Europe. The hitherto sacred principle of <i class="calibre8">laissez faire</i> too was gradually modified. Intervention by the government was, thus far, regarded as mischievous and futile, meddling with natural laws. This theoretical proposition, however, did not jibe with the facts of life as far as the workers were concerned. Civil liberties and the right to vote did not provide them any succour from poverty and the insecurity produced by unemployment, sickness, disability and old age. The workers, therefore, used their voting power and union organisation to press for social reforms. Under the force of these new pressures, a democratic liberalism developed which recognised the responsibility of the state for the welfare of its citizens.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, developed another variety of liberalism in Western Europe, particularly Germany, wherein social reform programmes including old age pensions, minimum wage laws, sickness, accident and unemployment insurance, regulation of hours and conditions of work here adopted by the government. These reforms were the prelude to the welfare state that has become the hallmark of our age.</p>
<p class="indent">Liberalism, despite changing and adjusting to the needs of the times, has steadily lost ground since the end of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and the main reason seems to be its failure to win the support of the emerging working class. In the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the workers have, by and large, turned to various brands of socialism of the Marxist or Christian variety. Thus, liberals all over the world have been squeezed between the socialists on the left and the conservatives on the right.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Liberalism?</b></i></span> Liberalism is based on the principle that there should be a symbiotic relationship between government and the community or between state and society, than existed under the dynastic regimes of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Instead of being aloof from society, government and administration should be based on the organised consent of at least the most important sections of the community and they should concern themselves with the interests of the whole community. The main hurdles to a broader basis of government were the powers and privileges of the aristocracy and the church, and the absence of privileges of the middle classes. Thus, the torchbearers of the <a id="calibre_link-408" class="calibre10"></a>liberal attack against feudal rights and religious power were the underprivileged middle and professional classes.</p>
<p class="indent">The philosophy of European liberalism was derived from the rationalist movement of the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, which has made a frontal attack upon inequality and arbitrary power. Its most salient feature was parliamentary government. It found in constitutional system and in the rule of law a means of expressing middle class interest and opinion. It was different from democracy or radicalism, in that it preferred ideas of sovereignty of parliamentary assemblies rather than the sovereignty of the people. Further, it demanded an extension of the franchise to include all men of property but to exclude men without property. Finally, it gave liberty greater importance than equality. To liberals, the French Revolution had damned itself by its excesses that had aroused the era of reaction and military dictatorship. The most preferable regime was either a constitutional monarchy, assuring certain rights equally to all citizens, or a parliamentary republic based on a restricted franchise but upholding the equality of all before the law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Democracy?</b></i></span> Democracy resembled liberalism; in that it derived its ideals from 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century rationalism and was equally opposed to the inequalities of the old order. It differed from it in holding to the view that sovereignty lay not in constitutional system or in representative parliamentary assemblies, but in the consent of the whole paper. It favoured universal male suffrage, the subordination of parliamentary bodies to the will of the electorate as a whole, and even devices of direct democracy such as the plebiscite or the referendum. It was devoted to the ideal of equality of political and civil rights. In its more extreme forms, it again demanded social and economic equality. Like liberals, democrats demanded equality of all before the law and equality of opportunity for all, but unlike liberals, they wanted to secure their rights even at the cost of greater economic levelling. For these reasons, in the first half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century democracy, was treated as a more revolutionary and frightening doctrine than liberalism. The fear of Jacobinism which haunted the conservative governments of Europe between 1815 and 1848 was partly the fear of the resurgence of French power; it was even more the fear of radical democracy. To resist this menace, liberals were often ready to join hands with conservatives to crush popular movements and uprisings that favoured democratic ideals. The 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century counterpart of this fear was the universal fear of Bolshevism after 1917. Democracy, even more than liberalism, was the central cause of change and revolution in the century after Waterloo.</p>
<p class="indent">There was enough common ground among liberals and democrats for them to join forces on the barricades at great revolutionary movements, such as in 1848 and 1871. Not only were both travelling for at least a certain distance along the same road and finding themselves obstructed by the same forces of conservatism, but both had the common desire to make government, in varying degrees, an organ and agency of society.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Background and Impact of 1830 Revolution?</b></i></span> Prince Metternich, the Chancellor of Austria, evolved a scheme at the Congress of Vienna for the suppression of liberalism and democracy. Though it succeeded for a time, it failed in the long run to contain these popular forces. The main factor responsible for the failure of the Congress was that “the real purpose of the Congress was to divide amongst the victors the spoils taken from the vanquished”. Following the Vienna Congress, conservatism enjoyed a brief period of ascendancy.</p>
<p class="indent">Soon, however, the forces for the promotion of liberalism and democracy got mobilised. Liberalism could not be so easily wished away as the representatives at the Vienna Congress had anticipated. The rising tide of nationalism <a id="calibre_link-409" class="calibre10"></a>was another threat against the established order. The combined strength of these forces finally destroyed the citadel of conservatism. Liberalism persisted even in countries that were carefully supervised, such as Germany and Italy. Students in German Universities formed secret societies for the promotion of liberal ideas. Demand for constitutional government and national independence came from the educated men in Italy. Metternich was able to suppress the occasional uprisings in Italian states, but he could not stamp out the ideas. The Greeks revolted against their Ottoman oppressors and won their independence (1827) despite Metternich’s passive resistance.</p>
<p class="indent">The French Revolution of July 1830, the first effective break in the settlements of 1815, was a real revival of the spirit of 1789. It drove out the Bourbons and placed on the throne a compromise candidate, Louis Philippe. The conservative powers feared a recurrence of the condition that followed the revolution of 1789 and in a measure, their fears were justified. The overthrow of Charles X in France was a signal for widespread revolt all over Holland. Outbreaks occurred in the German states also but they were quickly suppressed. Italy went through the throes of another outbreak, which Austria, after a bitter struggle was about to suppress. Liberals and democrats, in general, took courage and planned for further action.</p>
<p class="indent">In Great Britain, the reform of the electoral and parliamentary systems in 1832 helped to make legislative enactment the normal means of administrative and social changes. Just as the abolitionists succeeded in getting the reformed parliament to end slavery and just as the free traders induced parliament to repeal Corn Laws and Navigation Laws. So, a host of other zealous improving movements now concentrated upon Parliamentary action as the road to reform.</p>
<p class="indent">Most often, leaders of these movements were radicals of diverse hues, ranging from Chartists (seeking democratic reorganisation of the electorate and parliament) to ‘philosophical radicals’ like Edwin Chadwick and J.S. Mill and disciples of Jeremy Bentham (who sought to remodel public administration and the system of justice in terms of great efficiency and responsibility to the people). On some issues, these different movements would combine forces, on others they would fall into dispute. The common framework within which all worked was constitutional government and the purpose of most of their activities was to get a bill through parliament. Thus, they turned parliament into an instrument of social welfare.</p>
<p class="indent">The radical reformers succeeded in getting through parliament, in 1834, an Act to reform the whole system of ‘poor relief’. Though the reorganisation did not work out as had been intended by most enthusiastic supporters, the effect in the end was to yield a system of ‘poor relief’ more efficient in its working and more subject to democratic control than the old. The principle of delegating tasks of national administration to specially created authorities subject to local representative bodies was imitated for subsequent reforms, most significantly for the protection of public health.</p>
<p class="indent">In France, the July Monarchy (i.e., the monarchy that was set up after the July 1830 Revolution) brought a move in the same direction of providing the minimum conditions of a civilised life. Just as the British Parliament in 1833 passed an Act regulating child labour, so in 1841 the French Parliament passed an Act on the same lines. Just as the English Whigs reformed municipal government, so the French liberals in 1831 set up general district councils on which elected members could sit beside the nominated members. These elected members were gradually entrusted with the care of certain social welfare activities. Though the French state undertook a general supervision <a id="calibre_link-410" class="calibre10"></a>of the work of local Poor Law authorities in 1828 itself, it was slower than the British to take any direct share in Poor Law Administration. In education, however, the opposite was true. In 1833, when the British Parliament granted a meagre sum of 20,000 for the promotion of elementary education, the French government passed its Education Act, planning to set up state-aided primary schools in every commune.</p>
<p class="indent">In Belgium, its wealthy bourgeoisie showed in these years even less concern for <a id="calibre_link-411" class="calibre10"></a>social problems, though conditions in mines and factories in Belgium were no better, nor effects of economic depression any less severe than in Britain or France. Liberal and Catholic parliamentarians, representing the same social class, were in agreement that social questions did not matter politically. Wages were determined by the laws of supply and demand, and the poor had no rights, save to appeal to charity.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00004.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">In the whole of Germany, except Prussia, the relatively backward economic conditions were reflected in little effort to achieve social reform. Small firms and handicrafts traders persisted and governments were scarcely conscious of the pressure of more modern industrial problems. Similarly, elsewhere in Europe, no pattern of liberal reform could be detected. In Scandinavia, the Danish kings preserved their absolutist powers virtually intact; but the Swedish king had, by 1840, liberalised his government both in Sweden and Norway. In 1840, the king of Netherlands had so used his autocratic powers that he was forced to abdicate in favour of his more popular son. In general, the forces of conservatism remained dominant and usually repressive.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Nature and Impact of 1848&ndash;49 Revolution?</b></i></span> The liberal governments after 1830 were too inhibited by their dependence upon mercantile and manufacturing interests to handle effectively the social distress of their people. It became evident in one country after another that governments had still not been brought into sensitive enough relationships with the needs of the whole society to serve these needs efficiently. The inevitable result was a swelling demand for further liberal reforms and for immediate extensions of democratic policies. It were these pent up forces that brought about the almost universal revolution in 1848&ndash;49.</p>
<p class="indent">From West to East, Europe was threatened with outbreaks in 1848&ndash;49. As in 1789 and <a id="calibre_link-412" class="calibre10"></a>1830, the spark was ignited in France; Louis Philippe was overthrown and a republic was established. Revolutionary fervour penetrated Austria, the bulwark of conservatism, so that Metternich was forced to seek temporary shelter in another land. Italy joined the army of revolutionists and Germany followed suit. The revolts proved to be premature, as France under Napoleon III slipped back to conservatism and Austria recovered, after initial failure, to drive the revolutionists out of Italy and the German states. Absolute governments had been challenged but not destroyed. Russia, Austria and Germany managed to retain their reactionary governments until the time of World War I. A government by the people was destined to rise gradually through evolutionary principles, rather than through spontaneous revolutions. England was an excellent example of how effectively this could be done.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00030.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Revolutions of 1830 and 1848</p>
<p class="indent">The economic and social changes, combined with the new personnel and the new spirit of politics, made for important developments in the machinery of government and administration between 1850 and 1870. There grew up an uneasy feeling that parliamentary institutions, as they had developed by 1850, were inadequate for the needs of the changing societies of Western Europe. In Britain, these were decades of widespread popular agitation for improvements in the parliamentary systems, which the failure of Chartism had left unrealised. The Reform Act of 1867 for instance nearly doubled the electorate of England and Wales, mainly by giving the vote to all householders of one year’s residence in boroughs and all farmers in countries paying an annual rent of 12 pounds or more for their farms. In effect, it admitted to electoral power the whole of the lower middle class and the more well-to-do artisans of the towns. In 1868, this act was followed by comparable reforms in Scotland and Ireland. Although this important measure of parliamentary reform was so long delayed, the decades between 1850 and 1870 were years of incessant agitation for other reforms of all kinds.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Gladstone’s first administration of 1868&ndash;74 made itself a landmark in 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century English liberalism, because it put into effect many of the reforms which popular associations of the previous two decades had urged in vain. In 1872, it established secrecy of the ballot for all parliamentary and local elections. After 1870, it abolished patronage in the civil services and enforced recruitment by competitive examination; it carried out similar reforms in the army and greatly improved the conditions of military service; it reorganised the judicial system by the Judicature Act of 1873, remodelling both the legal system and the courts. By these reforms it equipped the state to perform more efficiently the increasing burden of work which the needs and demands of a more democratic electorate would soon impose upon it.</p>
<p class="indent">France offers certain striking parallels in these years, despite the superficially different course of her development. When Louis Napoleon, in December 1852 made himself Emperor of France by a coup, he reverted to a system of government, similar to that of his more illustrious namesake. He tried to mask and legitimise the usurpation by three devices: (a) by preserving the shadow of parliamentary government in the form of packed assemblies based on managed elections; (b) by popular plebiscites; and (c) by giving France, in his policy, what he thought would be most popular and beneficial to the nation. His rule became a strange mixture of authoritarian government with increasing concession to parliamentary power and popular demands. The final result was development of France’s parliamentary institution which made the Third Republic of 1875 possible.</p>
<p class="indent">France came to be ruled by a centralised despotism tempered only by opportunism and <a id="calibre_link-413" class="calibre10"></a>necessity from 1852. Within the next 18 years, France recovered bit by bit a more genuine system of parliamentary government. Universal male suffrage, instituted in 1848, he never dared to infringe, though he manipulated elections. In 1860, he had to make important concessions to parliament. The press, despite continued control and censorship, was allowed to publish fuller reports of parliamentary debates. From 1860 until 1869 further concessions had to be made to the growing clamour of the republican opposition. Despite many setbacks and handicaps, a vigorous and eventually successful republican opposition grew up. The so-called ‘Liberal Empire’ which came into existence after 1860 was at last as real a parliamentary regime as was the constitutional monarchy before 1848.</p>
<p class="indent">During this period, Belgium was governed by the liberal party Charles Roger, with the Catholic Party in opposition. As in other countries, the liberals tended to fall into his wings; the more doctrinate liberals demanding constitutional freedoms and believing in an economic policy of <i class="calibre8">laissez-faire</i>, and the more radical liberals concerned with extension of the franchise and improvement of social conditions. As in France, this division become especially important from 1863 onward; and as in France, trade union organisation was prohibited under the penal code. Only in 1867 did it become legal to organise workers, though labour organisations remained severely hampered in all their activities except as friendly societies and mutual aid associations.</p>
<p class="indent">In the development of parliamentary government in Britain, France and Belgium, between 1850 and 1870, a certain common pattern can be discerned underlying the more obvious differences. In all three, the institutions of parliamentary government were undoubtedly more deeply rooted, more resilient and more fully developed by 1870 than they had been in 1850 or they were elsewhere in 1870.</p>
<p class="indent">The Northern European states shared, to a large extent, in this common pattern of evolving parliamentary system after 1849. Here, a strong liberal party alternated in office throughout these years with the rival conservative party. In 1866, Sweden instituted a bicameral parliamentary system. Universal suffrage did not come, however, for another 50 years. In South Western Europe (Spain and Portugal), less solidly based constitutional systems fared less well, and these were years of acute instability. In part, the alternations of reactions and revolutions in Spain and Portugal were due to the instability of the monarchs themselves. Instability came mainly from the backward social development of these countries, which meant that no strong liberal parties could take shape. They lacked not only traditions of constitutional government and the habits engendered by them, but also the economic and social foundations on which the parliamentary parties of other western countries were developing.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did Europe Progress during 1870&ndash;1914?</b></i></span> In almost the whole of western and central Europe, parliamentary institutions developed between 1870 and 1914. They varied widely in form and in effectiveness, in their electoral basis and in the extent of their control over governments. Since most states were still kingdoms (Switzerland, France and after 1910, Portugal, being the only republics in Europe), these parliamentary institutions were usually, as in Great Britain, the bridge between strong centralised government authority and demands of people for more direct representations and more general participation in the shaping of national policies. They were at last a provisional solution to the old problem, which had agitated European civilisation since 1815, of how to establish a closer mutual relationship between <a id="calibre_link-414" class="calibre10"></a>the state and society, between government and community.</p>
<p class="indent">France was ahead of all other countries in having effective universal male suffrage from 1871 onwards. The electoral laws of 1848, which were revived in 1871 and again in 1875, gave the vote to some 10 million Frenchmen. The electorate of Britain after the reform acts of 1867&ndash;68 numbered only between 2.5 and 3 million. In 1884, Gladstone passed a further act which extended the electorate to about 5 million or roughly one-sixth of the population. This made the rural electorate as democratic as the urban, and was the first clear recognition to the radical principle that the individual was entitled to vote. It was followed by redistribution of seats which established constituencies for all the universities and the larger towns (above 50,000 people) together with the secret ballot, which had been instituted in 1872. These reforms launched Britain on the broad road towards political democracy. In neither Britain nor France were women given the parliamentary vote before 1914, and in Britain nearly a quarter of even the adult male population remained vote-less until 1918. Since the general principles of universal personal suffrage had now won the day, it was to be only a matter of time before they permeated the electoral systems of both countries.</p>
<p class="indent">Other West European states, having instituted parliamentary systems in the years before 1870, developed along comparable lines. In Belgium, until 1893 property qualifications restricted the electorate to less than 5 per cent of the population, but a reform of that year established universal male suffrage with the addition of plural voting for men with special property or educational qualification. In Netherlands, reforms of 1887 and 1896 extended the electorate from 2 per cent to 1 per cent of the population, but universal suffrage came only in 1917. Spain introduced the universal male suffrage in 1890 and Norway in 1898 Finland and Norway pioneered female suffrage in 1907. In Portugal and Sweden, the electorate remained comparatively restricted until after 1900. The two great new states of Germany and Italy differed widely in those respects. Bismarck had permitted the Reichstag (Parliament) to be elected by universal male suffrage, but the decisive power wielded by the upper house, and still more by the Emperor and his Chancellor, ensured that government could be conducted without undue dependence on a democratically elected assembly. In Italy, on the other hand, the constitutional monarchy retained its mid-19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century restrictiveness, and even the electoral reform of 1882 widened the electorate to only about 2 million or 17 per cent of the population. Most Italian men gained the vote at last in 1912. While the age for voting rights was 21 in Britain and France, in most other countries it was more. In Germany it was as high as 25, and in Italy, even in 1914, it was 30.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Outcome?</b></i></span> Underlying all these happening in spite of many divergences and restrictions, there can be discerned a great tide of movement. Democracy was advancing everywhere in Europe, and by 1914 it was touching the frontiers of Asia. The symbol was the right of the individual citizen to vote increasingly buttressed from the 1880s onwards by secrecy of the ballot. The vote was often endowed, by enthusiastic radicals and frightened conservatives alike, with a magic power. Too many radicals expected universal suffrage to bring the millennium, while too many conservatives and moderate liberals took the radicals at their word, and feared that democracy would demolish monarchy, Church, religion, and all that they cherished. Therefore, the struggle for extension of the franchise and secrecy of the ballot was long and bitter, raising exaggerated hopes on one side, excessive fear on the other.</p>
<p class="indent">By 1914, nearly every state in Western Europe had a code of legislation governing the <a id="calibre_link-415" class="calibre10"></a>building of houses and the making of streets; minimum standards of sanitation, safety and conditions of labour in factories, mines and mills, regulating the entry of ships into ports; and enforcing standards of purity and cleanliness in food and drink. Every state, in this minimum sense, was becoming a welfare state even before 1914. Hence, a host of important consequences followed. Parliament became busier passing legislation that imposed upon governments new kinds of work and organisation; local authorities and officials blossomed into fresh life; and new sources of taxation were tapped to finance such activities.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-54"><b class="calibre9">RUSSIAN REVOLUTION OF 1917&ndash;1921</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Russian revolution was a time of socioeconomic reconstruction in the Soviet Union. It was an escalation of the process which had adversely affected the autocracy after its defeat in the Crimean War (1856) and in the Russo-Japanese War (1904&ndash;05). While the revolution owes its origin to the incompatibility of the mystic authority of the Czars within increasingly industrialised society, the immediate cause was the inability of the prevalent system to manage a world war. In the short period of two and a half years, Russia suffered drastic damage &ndash; 5.5 million men died, the troops were short of ammunition and the civilians of food. To worsen the situation, in the last year of Czarism, there were four different prime ministers, three war ministers and three foreign ministers.</p>
<p class="indent">Among the revolutionaries there were two main groups &ndash; the liberal intelligentsia, who felt that Russia could win the war and become a democratic republic, and the Bolsheviks who regarded the ‘imperialist’ war as a lost one and preferred a drastic change to the economy. The second group was supported by social revolutionaries. The first group carried out the February Revolution while the Bolsheviks staged the October Revolution. (Russia was still using the Julian calendar in 1917, and was hence 13 days behind the West. Therefore, according to the West, each of the revolutions took place in the following months, i.e., in March and November respectively).</p>
<p class="indent">The first challenge the Bolsheviks faced after coming to power was that of creating the new socialist society which they had preached for so long. Soon they discovered that it was not an easy task. They had no examples to emulate in history and had to resort to experiments. Initially, there was no scope for experiments because the struggle for survival took precedence over everything else. The so-called ‘War Communism’ that prevailed between 1917 and 1921 evolved out of desperate measures taken to supply the battlefront with essential materials and manpower. Under this War Communism banks, lands, foreign traders and heavy industries were all nationalised. Surplus agricultural produce too was forcibly requisitioned to feed the troops and city dwellers. The original plan was to compensate the peasants with manufactured goods, but this proved impossible because all that was produced had to be sent to the front.</p>
<p class="indent">With the end of the civil war, the necessity for War Communism ended and it was promptly dropped. Lenin realised that concessions were unavoidable and this led to the adoption of the New Economic Policy, or NEP as it was popularly known, in 1921. It allowed a partial restoration of capitalism. Peasants could sell their produce on the open market and individuals were allowed to operate small stores and factories. The peasants and new merchants could employ labour and retain any profits.</p>
<p class="indent">However, Lenin ensured that the state retained control of title to land and banking, <a id="calibre_link-416" class="calibre10"></a>foreign trade, heavy industry and transportation. As Lenin saw it, the NEP did not mean the end of socialism but temporary retreat to prepare for a renewed march forward.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Take Place?</b></i></span> Discontentment was growing among the various interest groups of Russia, such as the proletariat, the peasantry, and the bourgeoisie. Despite the slow pace of modernisation of the industry and agriculture, considerable progress was made in the economic life of Russia during the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. In the early 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century Peter, the Great, had opened the doors of Russia to foreign trade which was later continued by Catherine and Alexander II. In the last quarter of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century considerable progress was made in establishing textile and metallurgical industries, and by 1900 about 269 foreign firms were operating in Russia. The introduction of all these reforms almost doubled her industrial output, but they also caused several new socio-economic problems.</p>
<p class="indent">The proletariat or workers in industrial centres had to live in pitiful conditions and worked in highly dangerous surroundings. Further, supply of labour was much more than the industries needed, and consequently the workers were at the mercy of their employers. Labour unions were not permitted to operate freely. Fear of the unions was so much that the state even colluded militarily with the employers to suppress unions. As a result, there was massive labour unrest and the strikes eventually began to take a political turn. Thus, agitations against the employers were turned against the rulers.</p>
<p class="indent">The peasants and serfs were no different from slaves, because they were bound to their land, sold by the lords along with the land, provided free labour for specified periods and could not even marry without the permission of the lords. (In the middle of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the serfs numbered 45 million. Half of them were directly under the Crown while the other half were under the nobles, the Church and other institutions.) Ever since the time of Peter, the Great, serfs had been agitating for emancipation. The agitation of the serfs was so strong in the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century that Alexander II appealed to the nobility to abolish it from below. Eventually the Czar succeeded in freeing the serfs, but could not ameliorate their economic conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">The Czar, besides freeing the serfs, also arranged for them to possess some land, which was kept with the village community, called the ‘Mir’. Every peasant worked in the Mir and claimed a share of the produce in return. Deprived of the land ownership, the serfs considered the Mirs as another kind of over-lordship. They were also convinced that the payment demanded from them for the land was unfair. Further, due to the process of industrialisation, handicrafts and rural industries were declining, and, on the whole, the opportunities and income of the peasants decreased. Consequently, the peasants began to agitate for more meaningful reforms, and between 1861 and 1917, staged a series of revolts. When the Revolution of 1917 broke out, they wholeheartedly supported it.</p>
<p class="indent">The Industrial Revolution produced a dynamic middle class, comprising merchants, industrialists and other businessmen, who were economically well-off, but had no significant political and social privileges. So, they combined with the intellectual liberals in demanding some system of representative government. Thus, when the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century dawned, the challenge to the autocratic system of Russia came more from liberalism than from socialism.</p>
<p class="indent">The middle class dominated Zemstovs (local assemblies) became active and came up with a definite programme of reform. They demanded a freely elected national assembly, a responsible ministry, equality of all citizens, and freedom of the press, religion and speech. Czar Nicholas II, who was against any kind of reform, turned a deaf ear to these demands.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-417" class="calibre10"></a>The Russian monarchy was autocratic without being efficient. The Czars who ruled the state enjoyed absolute powers. Believing in the divine theory of kingship, they never permitted their powers to be checked by anybody or institution. Till the end of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, people were kept out of political responsibilities, and there was no Parliament in Russia during this period.</p>
<p class="indent">The Russian autocracy stood discredited by military disasters on a number of occasions. In the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, Russia was involved in four great wars: the Napoleonic War, the Crimean War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the Great War of 1914&ndash;18. Excepting the first, the Russian army fared poorly in all the other wars, thereby exposing the weakness of the Russian military and political systems. This compelled the Czars to concede some reforms. The Crimean War was followed by the reforms of Alexander II, including the grant of freedom to the serfs; Russo-Japanese War was followed by the foundation of the Duma or the Parliament; the first World War ended the institution of monarchy and rule of the Czars.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the attempts of the Czars to close Russia from the liberal and radical ideas of the West, the influence of West European thought and practice was felt in the country and produced a movement disruptive of the established order. These influences naturally found expression in literature. The great novels of Tolstoy, Turgonev and Dostoviesky immensely inspired the young Russians. The radical intellectuals, on the other hand, fired up by Marx and Bakunin, turned to Socialism and Anarchism. One result of the influence of Anarchism was the growth of Nihilism which aimed at destroying everything in the existing order of Russia. Nihilism was, however, stamped out, but Socialism proved itself to be more lasting. It was from the new class of industrial workers, who had to work hard under pathetic working conditions, that the gospel of Socialism received the best response. In the 1890s, Marx’s teachings were made popular by radicals like the novelist Maxim Gorky, and revolutionary socialism made rapid progress among factory workers. The “Workmen’s Social Democratic Party” was formed in 1895.</p>
<p class="indent">The peasantry, now led by middle-class radicals, imitated the example of the urban proletariat and in 1901 organised the ‘Social Revolutionary Party’ with a programme that included the confiscation of the large estates of the nobility and their division into small individual holdings.</p>
<p class="indent">The Social Democratic Party, however, suffered a split on the questions of tactics and party discipline. Its radical section led by Vladmir Ulianov, better known as Lenin (pen name), broke away and came to be known as the ‘Bolsheviks’. The Bolsheviks advocated extreme measures and were keen to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat immediately by force and violence, if necessary. They did not recognise any class other than that of the workers, and were hostile to any collaboration with bourgeois political parties.</p>
<p class="indent">The moderate members of the party, known as ‘Mensheviks’, were less radical in their views and methods. They were willing to wait for the final success of Socialism by an evolutionary process, and were ready to cooperate with other political parties in overthrowing autocracy which they felt to be the immediate danger.</p>
<p class="indent">The immediate spark to the Revolution was, however, provided by the World War I by weakening the government machinery. While Russia suffered unprecedented losses in human beings on the battle front, on the home front, chaos was created by the inadequate handling of the supply of munitions. By mid-1915 both the centre and left groups in the Duma were demanding moderate reforms.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-418" class="calibre10"></a>Empress Alexandra actively opposed all reforms, and kept goading the Czar to act more autocratically. When Nicholas took personal command of the armies in field and prorogued the Duma, the empress virtually ruled at home. Her supremacy meant also the ascendancy of her favourite, the unscrupulous adventurer, Rasputin. With the Empress and her favourite in control, a gang of shady adventurers, blackmailers, and profiteers created a series of shocking scandals.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite continuous warnings from moderates in the Duma that the government itself was paving the way for a revolution by its failure to create a responsible ministry and to clean up the mass, the Czar reminded apathetic So, in the early months of 1917, all conditions favoured a revolution, but the revolutionaries themselves were not yet ready.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Areas Affected by the 1905 and 1917 Revolutions</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was February Revolution?</b></i></span> The February (March) Revolution of 1917 took everyone by surprise. Strikes and bread riots broke out in Petrograd due to a severe shortage of food and fuel. The army was ordered to restore normalcy, but the soldiers mutinied and joined the demonstrators. The Czar, always distrustful of the Duma, suspected it of complicity and ordered its dissolution. The Duma leaders refused to comply and the Czar discovered that he could no longer enforce discipline. Russia had no functioning government. This became a legal reality after Czar Nicholas abdicated in favour of his brother Michael, who too gave up the crown the next day.</p>

<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-419" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00084.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">A new structure had to be quickly created lest the radical elements on the streets take over. So a provisional government was set up to administer until a Constituent Assembly could be elected. The new government was headed by the liberal prince George Lovi and included Cadet leader, Professor Paul Milinkov, as foreign minister and Alexander Kerensky, the sole socialist, as minister for justice. This was a bourgeois government &ndash; liberal, middle of the road cabinet which favoured restricted reform. It proclaimed freedom of speech, press and assembly; announced amnesty for political and religious offences; acknowledged legal equality of all citizens without social, religious or racial discrimination; and passed labour legislation including the eight-hour day. Despite these reforms the provisional government could not stabilise itself. For eight months, it tried in vain to provide law and order and finally, like the Czarist regime it succeeded, collapsed helplessly.</p>
<p class="indent">The period between March and November was a time of tussle for power between the provisional government and the Soviets. In this struggle, the provisional government was seriously handicapped because it refused to consider the two things that the Russians wanted most &ndash; peace and land. While they counselled for patience, the Soviets were attracting the masses by demanding peace and immediate distribution of land.</p>
<p class="indent">The origin of the Soviets can be traced to the 1905 Revolution when workers elected councils, or Soviets, to coordinate the struggle against Czarism. Though suppressed at the time, the Soviets proved their value as organs for agitation and direct action. They had the quality the provisional government lacked&mdash;mass support. The Soviet movement spread rapidly through the country, developing into a grassroots government and challenging the government in Petrograd. Village Soviets organised seizure of nobles’ properties, city Soviets led unceasing demonstrations and street riots, and the soldiers’ Soviets gradually usurped the authority of officers to the point where they controlled weapons and counter-signed orders before they could be executed.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-420" class="calibre10"></a>In the initial stages, most of the elected members of to the Soviets were Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. The Bolsheviks were relatively insignificant until the return of their leaders from Switzerland. Lenin arrived in Petrograd on April 16 and issued his famous ‘April Thesis’ demanding immediate peace, land to the peasants and all power to the Soviets. In the light of what followed, Lenin’s demands may seem natural to us and logical too. In reality, they aroused great opposition within the Soviets amongst the Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, and some Bolsheviks. As Marxists, most delegates to the Soviets saw the March Revolution as a bourgeois uprising and believed that Socialist Revolution was out of question until Russia had undergone long term economic development. Their strategy, therefore, was to allow the provisional government to remain in office and to keep on prodding it for desired reforms and social change.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the October Revolution?</b></i></span> Lenin challenged this policy and called for an immediate revolution. He was almost alone in this, but time was on his side; the longer the war continued, the more discontented people became and the more popular Lenins’s slogans became. In six months, slogans that once sounded bizarre began to be seen as reasonable. By late 1917, people were desiring a second revolution, if that would rid them of the provisional government which was preventing the much sought after peace and land for all.</p>
<p class="indent">An early indication of changing public mood was the forced resignation of the Foreign Minister Milinkov. His insistence that Russia continue the war made him very unpopular. Hence he was dropped and a new provisional government was formed under Lvov and Kerensky. It was in office for a month only when Kerensky, who had been gradually becoming strong, organised a new government with himself as the prime minister. An indication of the mood of the country can be ascertained from the fact that the new ministers were mostly Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. Kerensky was cooperating with these two groups so as to counter Lenin and his Bolsheviks.</p>
<p class="indent">At this point, Kerensky announced that his aim was ‘to save the revolution from extremists’. Unfortunately, however, he did not get the support of the army and other conservatives. They regarded him as a weakwilled, loud-mouthed politician and wanted him to take immediate steps to crush the Soviets. His refusal to oblige sparked off an army revolt by Gen. Kornilov with the declared aim of freeing the government from Soviet domination.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the effect of Kornilov’s revolt had the opposite effect from what he intended. The Soviets took the lead in organising resistance against Kornilov and conducted propaganda against him until many of his troops abandoned him. Kornilov was thus defeated by the Soviets and Kerensky found himself under their domination. Additionally, the Bolsheviks were gaining influence within the Soviets as public opinion swung increasingly to the left. By October, the Bolsheviks established majority in both Moscow and Petrograd Soviets. Lenin decided that the time had come to overthrow Kerensky and bring about the second revolution. His party was, however, unsure and feared that it would not be able to retain power even if the provisional government was overthrown. Lenin convinced the Central Committee of his stand only after threatening to resign. The party voted for revolution and the date was set for November.</p>
<p class="indent">There was almost no resistance and the actual revolution was anti-climatic. The Bolshevik forces seized key positions in Petrograd &ndash; railway stations, banks, bridges and government buildings. The only bloodshed took place at the Winter Palace and the causalities there totalled <a id="calibre_link-421" class="calibre10"></a>one Red soldier and five Red sailors. Kerensky escaped and tried to organise a revolution. After this failed attempt, he fled abroad. The provisional government fell in a humiliating manner; with no fighting, Kerensky had as few supporters as Czar Nicholose had in March.</p>
<p class="indent">Lenin’s promise to the people was ‘Peace, Land and Bread.’ Workers established control of factories, private trade was banned, and the property of the Church and counter-revolutionaries seized. An armistice was arranged on December 5<sup class="calibre13">th</sup>, followed by the Treaty of Brest-Litousk on March 3, 1918. The first Soviet Constitution was promulgated the following July.</p>

<p class="caption">Trotsky</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was the Civil War Fought?</b></i></span> The Bolsheviks had to wage a bitter ‘Civil War’ (1917&ndash;20) against the counter-revolutionaries before they could hope to become masters of Russia. The counter-revolutionary armies (Whites) first organised resistance in December 1917. They were opposed by the ‘Red Army’ under the leadership of Trotsky. Several separate governments were established, and civil war continued for nearly three years in five regions, and the lack of cohesion between the various movements contributed to the Bolshevik success.</p>
<p class="indent">The Whites were a mixed bag, consisting of Social Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, ex-Czarist officers and several other groups which did not like what they had seen of the Bolsheviks. They were not aiming to restore the Czar, but simply to set up a parliamentary government on western lines. In Siberia, Admiral Kolchak set up a White government; General Denikin was in the Caucasus with a large White army. Most bizarre of all, the Czechoslovak Legion had seized long stretches of the Trans-Siberian Railway in the region of Omsk.</p>
<p class="indent">The situation was complicated by foreign intervention to help the Whites with the excuse that they wanted a government which will continue the war against Germany. When intervention continued even after the defeat of Germany, it became clear that the aim was to destroy the Bolshevik government which was now advocating world revolution. The situation looked grim for the Bolsheviks when early in 1919 Kolchak, whom the Allies intended to head the next government, advanced within three miles of Moscow, the new capital. However, Trotsky had done a remarkable job in creating the well-disciplined Red Army, based on conscription and including thousands of experienced officers from the old Czarist armies. Kolchak was forced back, and later captured and executed by the Reds; the Czech Legion was defeated and Denikin, advancing upon Moscow from the south, was forced to retreat. By the end of 1919, it was evident that the Bolsheviks would survive. From the Bolshevik point of view, however, the important thing was that they had won the civil war.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why and how did Foreign Intervention take Place?</b></i></span> A socialist regime in a capitalist world naturally sent danger signals in foreign countries and hence foreign intervention. For, there was all round economic distress and political unrest <a id="calibre_link-422" class="calibre10"></a>attending the World War I, and the western powers feared that the example of Russia might incite revolt among the working class within their own borders.</p>
<p class="indent">This fear was intensified by the Bolshevik propaganda for a world-wide Socialist Revolution. The Allied powers refused to recognise the Soviet government. The Soviet government was further alienated by Lenin’s repudiation of foreign debts contracted under the old regime. Hence, they felt it necessary to interfere in the affairs of Russia.</p>
<p class="indent">Their object was two-fold: to prevent Germany from exploiting the disturbed situation in Russia to her own advantage, and to overthrow the Bolshevik government by supporting various attempts at counter-revolution which were being made during the years 1917&ndash;1920.</p>
<p class="indent">An Allied expeditionary force landed at Archangal and Murmansk to support the anti-Bolshevik party in North Russia, and a similar force consisting mainly of Japanese soldiers, occupied Vladivostok. British forces occupied positions in the Caucasus and the French occupied some places in Southern Russia as bases for helping the counter-revolutionary movements. Of these, the most serious was that of Cossacks of the south led by Kornilov, then by Denikin and finally by Wrangel.</p>
<p class="indent">For a time, it seemed as though the Bolshevik government would collapse before foreign intervention and domestic revolts. To make matters worse, Poland, incited by France and anxious to extend her frontiers, declared war against Russia.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did Bolsheviks Succeed?</b></i></span> The Bolsheviks, however, pulled through all these troubles for which several causes are attributed. There was a great amount of disagreement in the ranks of the counter-revolutionaries, and so united action for any length of time became impossible. The royalists were at odds with the republicans, and the military leaders with the politicians.</p>
<p class="indent">The peasants supported the new government, because they feared the return of the old landlords, which would result in the loss of their newly acquired land. The workers were always with the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p class="indent">The Allied intervention was not only inadequate but also half-hearted. After the strain of World War I and with many post-war problems still unsolved, the Allies were not in a mood to undertake extensive military operations which were necessary to subjugate a huge country like Russia. Hence they withdrew their troops in 1919.</p>
<p class="indent">Deprived of foreign military support and weakened by divisions among themselves, the anti-Bolsheviks fared poorly against the Red Army under Trotsky. The counter-revolutionary forces were beaten everywhere and Poland was forced to come to an agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Significance of 1917 Revolution?</b></i></span> The Russian Revolution of 1917, particularly the October (November) Revolution, has a great significance for not only Russia but for the entire humanity. It had successfully demonstrated the Marxist theory of a revolution for the first time in history. Every aspect of Russian society, economy, polity, religion, etc., was completely overhauled and came to be organised on communist lines.</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, it disproved some of the theories of Marx that a Marxist Revolution can occur only in an industrially advanced and capitalist country. Thus, it gave Marxism a new dimension by demonstrating that a Marxist Revolution can take place even in a semi-industrialised country like Russia.</p>
<p class="indent">It was the first of its kind in the history of revolutions till then, where a single individual (Lenin) had played a crucial role.</p>
<p class="indent">Some scholars even contend that the origin of the later day Cold War and Super Power rivalry can be traced to this revolution.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-55"><a id="calibre_link-423" class="calibre10"></a><b class="calibre9">FASCIST COUNTER-REVOLUTION IN ITALY AND GERMANY</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The period between the World wars (1918&ndash;1939) was one ever-recurring turmoil and trouble. Hopes of a free and happier world received many setbacks, particularly on the continent of Europe, where undermining of authority and weak governments led to the establishment of a number of dictatorships of which two are especially characterised as being totalitarian regimes &ndash; Fascism in Italy and Nazism in Germany.</p>
<p class="indent">In Italy, the end of the World War I was followed by strikes, vigorous anti-German propaganda and denunciations of patriotism due to dissatisfaction with Italy’s territorial gains, and to high taxes and prices, which seemed to many to be the chief results of the war. A succession of weak governments failed to improve conditions, to restore public confidence, or even to maintain the semblance of order. Chafing under this state of affairs, a former Socialist, a man of fiery energy and blatant patriotism, Benito Mussolini, formed a party known as the ‘Fascist’ after the ‘fasces’ or rods which the victors or officers bore as symbols of their authority before the Roman Emperors. In 1922, a march on Rome was arranged and from that time until Mussolini’s fall from power in 1943 Italy was a fascist state. The king was nominally the head of state, but the real power was exercised by Mussolini. During that period, no opinion was tolerated except that of the state: press, platform and university were all expected to promulgate the new doctrines; disobedience meant imprisonment or exile to a remote island. Besides, Fascism was anti-communist, even though its leader had been once an advanced socialist. Despite its sinister features, Fascism did some material good in Italy, and the people were made conscious of their destiny as the heirs of traditions and culture of imperial Rome. At the same time, the militancy and arrogance of the ancient Roman spirit were also inculcated with results which were eventually to lead Fascism and the monarchy which supported it to complete disaster.</p>
<p class="indent">Among Mussolim’s admirers was an Austrian, named Adolf Hitler, a man of humble origin and little education who had served in the German army during World War I and had never risen above the rank of lance-corporal. After the war, Germany passed through a period of serious crisis. She failed to pay the heavy reparations demanded of her and depreciation of the currency reduced the value of the Mark (German currency) to such an extent that many Germans became destitute. Besides, the strong armies which the French, the Poles and Czechs were allowed to maintain on her boundaries caused uneasiness in Germany. When in 1929, the statesman Stressman who had honestly tried to organise the republic on non-military lines, died and soon after the Great Depression led to the withdrawal of American money from Germany, the condition of the country became so serious that the Germans were ready to hail almost any one as a saviour. This was Hitler’s great opportunity. Six years earlier, his party (the National Socialist or Nazi party) had failed so completely in an attempt to seize power that few could have expected its revival as a powerful factor in German politics. It was apathy and despair which made Hitler’s rise to power possible, but even so it could never have been achieved without the support which he got from German capitalists because he preached undeviating opposition to Communism, whose spread they had begun to fear. The government was too weak to suppress the brown-shirted private army which Hitler had gathered around him. In 1933, he became Chancellor and a year later, after the death of the aged president Hindenburg, the head of the German state.</p>
<p class="indent">As Chancellor, Hitler was responsible for Germany’s secession from the League of <a id="calibre_link-424" class="calibre10"></a>Nations, and as ‘Fuhrer’ or leader, he carried the struggle further by large scale rearmament, conscription, reoccupation of prohibited districts in the Rhine land, and repudiation of restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. His methods were frequently ruthless. Traitors were executed, and Jews and open opponents of the Nazi regime were consistently persecuted. The extent of his influence and fanatical reverence with which he was regarded by millions of his subject, are as remarkable as his rise to absolute power from so lowly a beginning. He certainly did much to make the Germans more self-reliant that they had been since their defeat in war, and to improve their physique. Unfortunately, all that was for one end. Germany was to be a great military empire again, the dominant power in Europe, and ultimately in the world. Self-reliance turned to arrogance and brutal interference in the affairs of other countries.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Fascism in Italy</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Facism?</b></i></span> ‘Fascism’, an Italian term, is derived from the word “Fascio”, which means a bundle. It denotes a centralised autocratic regime with extremely nationalistic policies and with an economic system based on state controlled capitalism. It was first used for the movement which started in Italy under the leadership of Benito Mussolini. The Italian parliamentary government had shown little concern for the welfare of agricultural and industrial workers whose conditions were miserable in the extreme. It had, instead, plunged Italy into World War I in the hope of gaining colonies, but the peace treaties had failed to satisfy the ambitions of the Italians. Further, the growing strength of the socialist movement in Italy posed a threat to the existing systems. Hence, the capitalists and the landlords who dominated the Italian government at the time began to support anti-democratic and anti-socialist movements which promised to save them from the danger of socialism as well as to satisfy their colonial aspirations.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-425" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00022.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fascist Regimes in Europe</p>
<p class="indent">Though the fascists gave up their street violence and gangsterism to a great extent after coming to power, they did not hesitate to use them whenever there was a threat to their position. They did not tolerate any opposition and, in fact, banned all political parties except their own party. Thus, its anti-democratic character gave rise to its authoritarian and totalitarian nature. Mussolini became the virtual dictator of Italy, though, in theory, the king remained the legal head of the stage. All the individuals and institutions within Italy were subordinated to the state. Thus, is clear from Mussolini’s statement that everything should be for the state and nothing against the state.</p>
<p class="indent">Though Mussolini was formerly a staunch Socialist before starting the fascist movement, he soon became the leader of a crusade against Socialism and Communism. After becoming a fascist, he lost the Marxist feature of reason and analysis but retained the Marxist preparedness for violence and action. So, with the help of his armed gangs, he let out reign of terror against the Socialists and Communists both before coming to power and after. The signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1937 with Nazi Germany and Japanese is evidence of his efforts to curb communism and socialism at the international level. Because of this anti-socialist and anti-communist feature of Italian Fascism, the capitalists and the big landlords of Italy became its supporters. The economic policy of the Fascists, though was pro-worker and pro-peasant before coming to power soon became pro-capitalist and the big industrialists and landlords made merry at the expense of small industrialists and small peasants.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the primary objectives of Italian Fascism was to heighten the prestige of Italy in the eyes of foreign nations. Hence, they glorified war as a symbol of national virility. They aimed at reviving the prestige of ancient Rome, and securing for Italy the position of a world power. Though the nationalism of the fascists was highly irrational, symbolic and ritualistic, it was the most important thing as an emotional feeling to secure for Fascism the support of divergent sections of the Italian society. This feature of Italian Fascism amply explains Fascist Italy’s conquest of Albania and Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and also her participation in the World War II.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What Led to the Rise of Facism?</b></i></span> It should be noted that the extensions of the franchise between 1870 and 1912 outran the growth of literacy so that the electorate were not sufficiently enlightened to make parliamentary democracy a success. On account of the prevalence of a regional spirit, a healthy party life did not develop. The members formed themselves into groups and in each group there was a tendency to fissure. All of these, coupled with the corruption which corroded the public life of Italy, enabled the politicians to reduce politics to a game of skill.</p>
<p class="indent">Governments, therefore, became unstable, a matter of expedients and shifts, beaten groups, a policy with which the name off Giolitti is most prominently associated in the years before the Great War. The result was a certain discrediting of parliamentary and democratic government as unsuited to Italy, an alien to her traditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Many ardent Italian nationalists felt that Italy had not been sufficiently compensated for her efforts and sacrifices in the war. They wanted a government which would take up a hard line <a id="calibre_link-426" class="calibre10"></a>and not be conciliatory in its attitude towards international affairs.</p>
<p class="indent">The problems of readjustment to post-war conditions appeared too great for people who were by nature impatient and highly mercurial. During the war and after, Italy was full of disorder and discontent arising mostly from economic and financial hardships. Poor before, she was poorer now, because of war expenditures. The cost of living rose very high. As a result, the people, particularly the lower classes like labourers, peasants, etc., suffered greatly.</p>
<p class="indent">There were many disorders arising out of activities of the socialists and the communists. Socialism and communism, which had been active before the war, now increased their strength. In many quarters, especially the industrial regions of the north, there were serious labour strikes and in some cases, the workers seized the factories. Even the peasantry were affected. For, in some of the rural communities the peasantry drove out the landlords and seized their properties. A social revolution seemed to threaten the country and it looked, for some years, as if Italy might go communists. The government under Nitti, and then under Giolitti, proved incapable of dealing with the situation, and its prestige was badly shaken. Bold leadership was wanted, and this was eventually supplied by the fascists.</p>
<p class="indent">The Fascists, under Mussolini, showed the ability to win over the support of several disparate and contradictory sections of the Italian population. Due to the autonomy of the local groups of Fascists, they could graft themselves on to local traditions, to exploit local rivalries, to appear republican, syndicalist, nationalist, etc., according to the strength of the local social grouping and political traditions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Its Social Base?</b></i></span> Support for Fascism, to begin with, came mainly from the middle classes of the petty bourgeoisie of small employers, shopkeepers, and the various professional classes. To these classes, faced with a serious decline in living standards, Fascism offered not only psychological reassurance but a means of overcoming the serious defect of disorganisation which rendered them helpless in the face of pressure from the forces of organised capitalism, on the one hand, and the trade unions on the other. It was hoped that the Syndical state, promised by the Fascists, by making organisations universal and compulsory, would end the disadvantageous position of the middle classes who would, in fact, become the arbiters of disagreement between capital and labour.</p>
<p class="indent">Another socially ‘marginal’ group which supported Fascism was the intellectual proletariat or ‘Boheme’ consisting of unsuccessful journalists, aspiring be poets and dramatists, and out-of-work publishers. Fascism offered them a career and the recognition which had eluded them. The ex-servicemen and the volunteers found an outlet for their talent and experience in the organisation of the Fascist movement, which believed in violent action and terrorism.</p>
<p class="indent">The growth of the ‘Fasci’ was powerfully assisted and sometimes even initiated by the regular army. The anti-militarist propaganda of the socialists and frequent incidents in which workers attacked officers on leave influenced their grievances. The failure of the parliamentary government to restore order and vacillation of successive government over the question of military reorganisation helped the army to come out openly in support of Fascism.</p>
<p class="indent">The common policeman could not but sympathise with the Fascists after they had been exposed to the constant harassment, insults and often violence of the extreme left for the two years. The same reasons were responsible for the partisan attitude of the magistrates. This attitude of the organs of the government, compounded equally of partiality and fear, allowed the Fascists to bring about the complete disintegration of the liberal state.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-427" class="calibre10"></a>Some industrialists and propertied people were from the beginning willing to participate actively in the fascist movement, as the instrument of anti-Bolshevik crusade. However, in the initial period of fascism, the traditional industrial establishment of ship-builders, steel-makers, or automobile manufacturers did not support Mussolini. It was the war-time profiteers, fearful of punitive taxation or confiscation, and the local entrepreneurs of agrarian-based industries that gave full support to Fascists in those early years. Given the relationship between heavy industry and the state, it was inevitable that, once Fascism had shown its power to seize control of the state, support would also come from the heavy industrial establishment.</p>
<p class="indent">Landlords and peasants, however, were far more committed to the success of the movement. The landlords supported it since it seemed to be the best instrument to check Bolshevism, while the peasant supported it because the Fascists promised, at least in the initial stages, agrarian reforms like land to the tiller, etc. Besides, the agrarians never had an organisation of their own comparable in efficiency to the ‘Confindustria’ (Confederation of industrial leaders). This failure created a strong resentment against the parliamentary government. The agrarian class was, therefore, less concerned than the industrialists to back the Fascists in demanding a clear sweep.</p>
<p class="indent">Mussolini, being an opportunist, saw the necessity of coming to terms with the Church. As a connoisseur of collective psychology, he could not fail to appreciate the force and influence of the Church. On the other hand, the dignitaries of the Church were ready to respond to his overtures. They might dislike and fear the Fascists, but they disliked and feared the socialists more. As a result, a good number of Catholics joined the Fascist movement. Thus, Mussolini was able to get the support of even the Church. Similarly, Fascism had to accept the continuation of the Monarchy which had the direct loyalty of the armed forces. In return, the crown supported Fascism.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00049.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Mussolini</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, Fascism had arisen as a mass movement on a local basis by the creation of local fascio. Because of their autonomy, the fascio were able to graft themselves on to local traditions &ndash; to exploit local rivalries, according to the strength of the local social groupings and political traditions. In this manner, through its democracy and actions, Fascism claimed support from different and contradictory sections of the population and emerged as a mass party.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Economic Policy?</b></i></span> After coming to power, Fascism tried to reform the nation’s fiscal system by abolishing extraordinary tax on war profits and property and rescind the requirement that stocks and bounds be registered in the name of the owner; all in an effort to stimulate savings and capital investment. All these measures produced the <a id="calibre_link-428" class="calibre10"></a>highest rate of saving and capital accumulation and a rate of industrial growth that doubled Italy’s total output by 1929. Iron and steel production and electrical power generation were doubled. This shows that during 1922&ndash;1929 Italy was undergoing extensive economic and industrial development and modernisation.</p>
<p class="indent">This development was not a well-balanced one. The large grain, coal and scrap metal imports began to create structural tensions throughout the economy by 1926 itself. As a result, the international exchange value of the Lire (Italian currency) declined. Consequently, the fascist government was forced to undertake two main programmes &ndash; ‘The Battle for Grain’ and ‘The Battle for the Lire’. Due to the measures taken under the first programme, the production of grain per hectare increased from 10.5 quintals (1928) to 15.2 quintals per hectare in 1932. By 1935, Italy was no longer compelled to expend 15 percent off its total foreign exchange for the importation of cereals. However, this programme, just like so many other Fascist programmes, benefited the larger proprietors than small proprietors. The second programme was rather mainly used by Mussolini to extend political control over the economy.</p>
<p class="indent">Fascist Italy fell victim to all the consequences of the world Depression of 1929&ndash;1932. Most of the policies pursued by the Italian Fascist government, such as taking over the banks, setting up of specialised institutions for economic recovery, lowering of salaries and wages in response to the crisis, etc., were in many ways similar to those undertaken by non-fascist governments on the Continent and in the U.S.</p>
<p class="indent">Whatever economic measures and programs the Fascists state undertook helped the big industrialist and large farm holders, whether directly or indirectly. The small industrialists, the small farmers and other middle classes always suffered, or at least did not benefit. Whether Fascism had intended to serve as a conservative movement or not, its policies directly or indirectly saved the conservative section of the Italian society.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Labour Policy?</b></i></span> Prior to the Fascist seizure of the power, they set up ‘corporations’ within the party at Bologna in January 1922. These corporations included representatives of capital and labour. Each corporation, in addition to representatives of the employers and employed, contained there members of the Fascist party to ‘represent the public’. Though Mussolini was highly proud of his corporative state and declared that Fascist Italy had solved the social question of the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, even Fascist sympathisers agree that the corporative system did not work in Italy. It added a bureaucracy of its own, but did not help either the production or the producers.</p>
<p class="indent">The issue of labour was not seriously tackled by the Fascist government until the beginning of 1926. In April 1926 all strikes and lockouts were forbidden. Even before this, due to the disintegration of the traditional working class organisations and the rapid expansion of Fascist Syndicalism, strike activity declined rapidly in Italy. As a result of the decline in aggressive working class defence of wages and living conditions, the real salaries of the workers also declined.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Policy Towards the Church?</b></i></span> The Fascists had to make a compromise with the church in order to get its support even before coming to power. Even after coming to power, they continued the same policy. Mussolini proved his respect for the church during his first 18 months in office by restoration of the crucifix in schools and public places, raising the stipends of the clergy, etc. In return, the church and the clerico-moderates extended their benevolent neutrality towards Fascists and supported Mussolini’s rule.</p>
<p class="indent">During 1925&ndash;26 the elimination of Popolari (Catholic party) and the consolidation of the <a id="calibre_link-429" class="calibre10"></a>dictatorship seriously alarmed the Church. Hence, the Pope himself undertook serious negotiations for a settlement of the Roman question. Finally, the “Lateran Agreements” consisting of the Treaty and the Concordat, were concluded in February 1929. The former was a political settlement according to which many political issues were solved. By the latter, Catholicism was confirmed the religion of the state.</p>
<p class="indent">These agreements, however, only started a fresh conflict. In 1931 both the parties started throwing accusations at each other. A breach between the Duce (Mussolini) and the Pope appeared imminent. It was in the nature of Italian Fascism that this did not occur. A compromise was reached early in September 1931, according to which the Catholic youth associations, which had been condemned and banned by the government in May, were re-allowed. After this, during the period between 1931 and 1938, the forces of Catholicism went a long way in adopting the slogans of the Fascist regime, especially in the fields of demographic policy, corporatism, and imperial expansion. The spread of hybrid clerico-fascist ideology was fortunately halted by the alliance of Mussolini with Hitler and the racial laws.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Foreign Policy?</b></i></span> The Fascists glorified war as a symbol of national virility, and they aimed at reviving the prestige of ancient Rome and securing for Italy the position of the world power. At the Versailles Peace Conference, the Allies had neglected Italy in the distribution of mandates, and so Mussolini sought to rectify this wrong by adopting a vigorous policy of colonial expansion.</p>
<p class="indent">His first objects were Tunisia and Corsica which were French possessions. Mussolini maintained that Italy had a better right to them. Besides, the two countries were competing for the control of the Western Mediterranean and superiority in naval armaments. Mussolini’s provocative utterances put a severe strain on Franco-Italian relations for a time and produced a crisis. It was, somehow, averted for the time being.</p>
<p class="indent">Mussolini turned then his attention to Eastern Europe, where he obtained the Dodecanese islands and Fiume in 1924. Italy’s relations with Yugoslavia also became more and more strained as the latter, promoted by Irredentist Movements (movement for redeeming land from foreign occupation), wanted to acquire a large portion of Dalmatia from Italy. The Italo-Yugoslav quarrel was in essence a struggle for the control of the Adriatic. This struggle was further intensified when Mussolini conquered Albania in 1933.</p>
<p class="indent">The most creditable achievement of Mussolini in the international affairs was his conquest of Ethiopia. Apparently, he wanted to take revenge for the humiliation of Italian forces at Adowa by the Abyssinians (people of Ethiopia) in 1896. The actual reason was that Italy was in need of colonies to enhance her prestige and to find more room and food for her growing population. Hence Mussolini took advantage of border ‘incidents’ at Walwal to attack Ethiopia in 1935. Its king appealed to the League of Nations for arbitration, which promptly declared Italy to be the aggressor. Mussolini, however, defied the League, conquered Ethiopia and proclaimed King Victor Emmannuel III as the Emperor of Ethiopia. Thereafter, Italy came closer to Germany, while her relations with France and Britain got strained.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1937, Italy became a signatory to the Anti-Comintern Pact, signed by Germany and Japan in 1936. Its ostensible object was to check the spread of Communism at the international level. So, in the civil war that the broke out in Spain in 1936, Italy and Germany supported insurgents headed by General Franco while Soviet Union supported the existing government. Thus, the Spanish Civil War ceased to be in the domestic concern of Spain alone but developed into a struggle <a id="calibre_link-430" class="calibre10"></a>between Communism and Fascism, fought on Spanish territory. It was a prelude to the larger struggle that followed very soon.</p>
<p class="indent">Mussolini arrived at an understanding with Hitler and, thus, began the Rome-Berlin Axis. When the Second World War broke out and the power of France collapsed, Mussolini joined Germany and declared war on Britain and France (1940). Mussolini’s object was to take advantage of Britain’s critical position to snatch away the British colonies in North Africa and to take Egypt and Suez Canal. The Italians had some initial success but were soon thrown back by the British who took possession of most of the African colonies of Italy such as Eritrea, Ethiopia, etc. Mussolini’s African gamble had failed, and the Allied victory in North Africa proved to be the prelude to his fall.</p>
<p class="indent">Mussolini soon fell from power and Italy capitulated unconditionally. The German army in Italy offered a tough resistance and held up the Allied forces for five months. Rome was taken in June 1944. Before this, Mussolini was shot dead by the anti-Fascists. Thus ended the life of this phenomenal demagogue and the movement he founded in Italy.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Nazism in Germany</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Nazism?</b></i></span> ‘Nazism’ is a German from of Fascism in particular and a part of the right-wing movement in general. It started in Germany 1919 as a political movement. Its official name was National Socialist German Workers Party, but it soon became popularly known as the Nazi party and its followers were called ‘Nazis’. When Adolf Hitler joined the party, it consisted of a little group of unimportant malcontents in Munich. Yet within 14 years, it became the biggest mass movement in German history, including in its cadre members of almost all groups of German society, from the unemployed workers to members of the imperial family of the Hohenzollerns and of several of the royal houses of the German states.</p>
<p class="indent">The essential features of German Nazism are similar to those of Italian Fascism. Appeal to the nationalist feeling of the highly sensitive Germans was one of the main ways through which Hitler and his Nazi party became so popular. The form of nationalism that Hitler evoked in the Germans was so extreme that we cannot make any distinction between this extreme form of nationalism and militarism. This union between nationalism and militarism can, in fact, be seen clearly not only in Germany under Hitler, but also in Italy under Mussolini and in Japan between 1928 and 1945.</p>
<p class="indent">Nazism abhorred and hence suppressed all forms of democracy, and throughout the reign of the Nazis in Germany we can witness innumerable anti-democratic measures. Besides, the Nazis, like the Fascists in Italy, held that the individual exists for the sake of the state and not vice-versa. This anti-individualist nature of Nazism was due to the influence of the authoritarian and totalitarian political thinkers, like Hegel, Nietzsche etc., on the Nazis. Hence, during the period of Nazi dictatorship, individual was subordinated to the state in every conceivable form.</p>
<p class="indent">The Nazis believed that the real threat to their position came from the communists. Initially when they were consolidating their position against social democrats, they adopted friendly posture towards the communists in Germany and also signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan and Italy in 1936&ndash;37. This anti-communist characteristic of Nazism can also be seen in the ruthless suppression of the trade unions by the Nazis in Germany.</p>
<p class="indent">Nazis captured power in Germany during the period of a crisis through a clever manipulation of the frustrations of the people. They were fully aware that they could remain in power only through perpetuating that crisis. Germany between 1933&ndash;36 recovered from the economic crisis which brought Nazis to power. Therefore, it was necessary for the Nazis to create some <a id="calibre_link-431" class="calibre10"></a>other crisis in order to remain in power. The need to create an artificial crisis was thus one of the most important causes for the aggressive foreign policy of Hitler and his occupation of the neighbouring countries, which ultimately resulted in the outbreak of the World War II.</p>
<p class="indent">Some Marxist scholars hold that Nazism was a response to a crisis in Capitalism, and hence its basic purpose was to revive Capitalism. Whether this opinion is acceptable or not, the fact remains that under the Nazi rule, Capitalism in Germany recovered from the crisis of 1929&ndash;32 and made good progress throughout. So, whatever might have been the purpose of Nazism, Nazism was undoubtedly pro-capitalist.</p>
<p class="indent">The Nazis believed that all the problems of Germany were due to the activities of the Jews, who belonged to the Semitic race. The economic problems of Germany were ascribed to the economic domination of Germany by the Jews, most of whom were money-lenders and bankers. Even the defeat of Germany in the World War I was ascribed to the betrayal of Germany by German Jews. Thus, the resentment against the economic domination of Germany by Jews was given a racial colour. This anti-Semitic nature of Nazism explains the persecution and even physical extermination of millions of Jews not only in Germany but all over Europe. This feature is peculiar and unique to Nazism as it is not to be found either in Italian Fascism or Japanese Militarism.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What Led to its Rise in Germany?</b></i></span> There was a kind of malaise in the German society and economy in the form of general disaffection or discontentment of the major groups at this time. We should, however, remember that the disaffection was structural and endemic in all Western industrialised societies. It was intensified in Germany due to some historical factors like non-competitive highly centralised high priced industrial economy, disproportionate influence of a small class of land owners (the Junkers), too many rural small landholders inflated urban petty bourgeoisie, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">The Versailles Treaty with all its humiliating terms and restrictions, adverse economic consequences of the war, the generation of demobilise soldiers, the floating population of eastern refugees of mostly aristocrats, the liquidation of millions of war loans floated with middle class savings, etc., further complicated the socio-economic problems of Germany. The results were paradoxical: on the one hand, consistent and uninterrupted extension of the social tendencies of the pre-war era, and on the other hand, ideological misinterpretation of these tendencies were reflected in the loss of economic independence, the ballooning white collar population and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">The World Depression adversely affected not only the U.S.A., France, England but also Germany. After the World War I, Germany was required to pay huge amounts to Britain and France as war indemnity. It borrowed heavily from these two countries, which, in turn, got their loans from the U.S. When the crisis began in New York finances market, the U.S. recalled the money from Britain and France, who, in turn, recalled their money that was lent out to Germany. Hence, the real brunt of the crisis was borne by Germany.</p>
<p class="indent">The Social Democrats who were in power in Germany at this time could not offer any concrete solutions to these accumulated problems of Germany, which were further aggravated by the world economic crisis. The Nazis, on the other hand, fully exploited the situation to their advantage and succeeded in attracting the discontented social groups to their side by their ideology.</p>
<p class="indent">Authoritarian and totalitarian traditions of German thinkers like Hegel, Nietzsche, Trietsche, etc. were also responsible for the rise of Nazism in Germany. Hegel held that the “State was the march of God on Earth”, and hence the individual exists for the sake <a id="calibre_link-432" class="calibre10"></a>of the state and not vice versa. Nietzsche put forward the concept of “Super Man”, and held that everything within the state should be subordinated to him. The Nazis borrowed very generously form the theories of these German authoritarian and totalitarian thinkers in formulating their own ideas of state.</p>
<p class="indent">Adolf Hitler, gifted by demonic dynamism and possessing mesmeric powers, swayed multitude of discontented Germans, and gave the impression of rescuing Germany from the despair into which she had sunk after the Treaty of Versailles. With terrorism, and violence, by demonic frenzy and impressive showmanship by unceasing propaganda, with an instinctive perception of human weakness and a satanic exploitation of it, he enlarged and maintained his power.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Social Base?</b></i></span> Most of the original members of the Nazi party were marginal characters, i.e., those who were failures or disappointed in life, and did not belong to any one social group. Soon it secured the support of many social classes such as the old aristocracy, the clergy, the peasants and the urban classes or petty bourgeois consisting of artisans, retail trades, white collar workers, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">The old aristocracy and the clergy, for instance, were losing their former social and economic privileges because of the Industrial Revolution. The peasantry and the petty bourgeoisie, though were not losing because of the Industrial Revolution, were not offered any bright future by it either. Instead, they were suffering a lot due to the social and economic problems of Germany which were made more complex by the adverse effects of the World War I and which became unbearable due to World Depression of 1929&ndash;32.</p>
<p class="indent">The seizure of power by the Nazi party would hardly have been possible without the support of considerable circles of big industrialists during the period. This explains the pro-capitalist measures of the Nazis at least between 1934&ndash;36.</p>
<p class="indent">Faced with all the accumulated problems, the above social groups sought to find solutions to the structural problems of the social order of Weimar Germany in Nazism, i.e., national glory, cult of the leader, anti-Semitism, anti-communism, etc. These various social groups, which joined it during 1930&ndash;31, saw compatibility between the new political style and the vigorous pursuit of their social and economic interests within the movement. Nazi party’s uncertainty and opportunism on many specific questions, the socially heterogeneous character of its following, the ruthlessness with which decisions were implemented, etc., only strengthened their hopes. Thus, Nazism was a vehicle sought by the various disaffected social groups to solve their problems. By promising everything to everyone, Nazism promised nothing to no one.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did the Nazis Rise to Power?</b></i></span> Under Stressman’s leadership, Germany from 1923 and 1929 shared in the general recovery of Europe and the Dawes Plan began to work. This, by better situation, gave a false appearance of greater stability to the Republic. The Republican government represented a coalition of diverse elements and could not pursue any consistent policy of internal reforms. Nor was its foreign policy very popular, for it had accepted the imposed Treaty of Versailles. In 1929, two things occurred which showed the real weakness of the Republic. Stressman died, leaving his work of political rehabilitation unfinished, and the great world slump of 1929&ndash;32 gripped an already enfeebled Germany, making all classes desperate. Thus, a situation was produced which provided Hitler and his Nazis a unique opportunity to come to power. The Nazis were already strong in the Reichstag (German Parliament) and it became increasingly difficult for the social democrats to carry on government <a id="calibre_link-433" class="calibre10"></a>without their cooperation. At last, on 30<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> January 1933, President Hindenburg was forced to accept Hitler as Chancellor of Germany.</p>
<p class="indent">To begin with Hitler was determined to transform his chancellorship into a dictatorship. His first step was to dissolve the Reichstag and call for new elections. During the campaign, opposition candidates were intimidated by violence and threats, and were not allowed radio time and free use of the press. Even then a Nazi victory in the election did not appear certain. On February 27, 1933, fire broke out in the Reichstag building (set probably by the Nazis themselves) and Hitler could point to it as a sample of disorder that the communist were likely to cause. President Hindenburg passed emergency decrees suspending free speech and free press, and thus made it easier for the storm troopers of Hitler to use terror against his political opponents.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite their violent campaign, the Nazis won only 44 per cent of the votes. Using the musclemen of his party as a constant threat, Hitler bullied the Reichstag. Except for the Social Democrats (the communists were denied their seats), all the other members of the Reichstag voted for the infamous Enabling Act (March 23, 1933). This act gave dictatorial powers to the government and suspended the constitution.</p>
<p class="indent">Now Hitler could act as he chose. He deprived the state governments of the powers they had under Weimar and transformed Germany into a strongly centralised state (April 1933). He appointed governors from Berlin who had the power to override the state legislatures. After the death of President Hindenburg in August 1934, Hitler became the president as well as the chancellor, but preferred to use the title Der Fuhrer (the leader) to describe himself. This change was legalised by a plebiscite in which he got 88 percent of the votes cast.</p>
<p class="indent">All opposition political parties were forced to dissolve. The government prohibited Communists and Socialists (May 1933); the nationalists dissolved themselves (June 1933); the government did away with the Catholic Parties (July 1933) and all monarchist groups (February 1934). By July 1933 itself, the Nazis were announced to be the only legal political party in Germany.</p>
<p class="indent">But within the Nazi party itself, a serious threat was posed by those who sincerely believed in Hitler’s more radical pronouncements on socioeconomic issues. Majority in the SA were such men and most of them came from the lower middle classes. They were also distressed by the way in which Hitler had used their organisation. Although the SA had helped him to come to power, now it was seen as an embarrassment to him. It was no longer quite respectable and certainly not in favour as were the SS (Secret State Police or the Gestapo) and the army.</p>
<p class="indent">On July 30, 1934 Hitler personally carried out the much hyped ‘blood purge’ or as he himself described it “The Night of Long Knives”. Roehm himself, founder and leader of SA, was shot, and so were 73 others by Hitler’s own admission. However, independent observers put the causalities as high as 1000. Among the victims were eminent Catholics and several Generals, all of whom were jointly charged by Hitler, with a plot on his life. In <a id="calibre_link-434" class="calibre10"></a>any case, after June 1934 there was no further opposition to Hitler within or without Nazi party or outside.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were its Anti-Semitist and Racist Policies?</b></i></span>Shortly after the enactment of the Enabling Act, Hitler delivered the first of his blows against the Jews, whom he had so long denounced. In a country of nearly 60 million people, the Jews formed less than 1 percent of the population, not including part Jewish Germans. The Jews had been very successful professionals and had made tremendous contribution to German culture. The Jewish businesses and professions were boycotted and Jews were prohibited to hold office (April 1933), although a temporary exception was made for veterans of World War I.</p>
<p class="indent">In the ‘Nuremberg Laws’ of September 15, 1935 a Jew was defined as any person with one Jewish grandparent. All such persons were deprived of German citizenship. Inter-marriage between Jews and non-Jews was forbidden as radical pollution. Jews were not allowed to fly the national flag, write or publish, act on stage or screen, teach in any educational institution, work in a bank, exhibit paintings or give concerts, work in a hospital, etc. They were not eligible for unemployment insurance or charity and the names of Jews who died in Germany in World War I were removed from war memorials. Influenced by the government sponsored propaganda, several towns and villages refused to permit Jews to live inside their precincts. Jews were forced to take special names, wear yellow stars of David and to belong to a ‘Union of Jews’.</p>
<p class="indent">Few Jews succeeded in leaving Germany, but it was usually at the cost of giving up all their possessions they were, however, the fortunate ones. These together with other measures were all designed to drive the Jews into ghettos and starvation. These were only a prelude to the physical extermination in gas chambers which they were to be subjected to by the Nazis during World War II. What horrified independent observers much more than the actions themselves was the inability of any substantial number of highly educated and civilised non-Jewish Germans to make kind of protest against this worst human carnage.</p>
<p class="indent">Nazi eagerness for racial purity had its positive as well as its negative consequences. The ideal blue-eyed blond “Nordic types” were required to mate with each other at an young age to produce as many children as possible. Additionally, to keep the race pure, sterilisation <a id="calibre_link-435" class="calibre10"></a>was introduced purportedly for the prevention of genetic diseases. A ‘Court of Eugenics’ consisting of a judge, a doctor, a specialist in hereditary diseases, had to judge each case. Medical experimentation of unimaginable cruelty and inconceivable scientific value was also conducted during the war on human beings of the so-called inferior races, such as Jews, Poles and other Slavs and Gypsies. These practices were the direct result of Nazi “Eugenic” legislation.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00076.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Prisoners of a Concentration Camp after Release</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were its Agrarian and Industrial Policies?</b></i></span> In agriculture, the Nazis had the objective of hundred percent self-sufficiency, along with comprehensive political control over the peasantry. The Junkers (landlords) were fully protected, with no attempt being made to divide their large estates. The government determined the production required of farmers and decided farm prices as well as wages. Waste land was brought under cultivation and private citizens were required to grow vegetables, in green houses. All these were integral to Hitler’s preparation for war. By 1937 Germany attained 83 per cent self-sufficiency in agriculture, a rise of 8 per cent since the Nazis had come to power.</p>
<p class="indent">Inspired by Stalin, Hitler adopted a four year plan in 1933. The first plan (1933&ndash;36) had the chief objective of economic recovery and unemployment eradication. Labour camps for men and women reduced unemployment, as did rearmament and a programme of public works. By 1936 unemployment had come down from 7 million to less than 1.5 million.</p>
<p class="indent">The second plan (1936&ndash;39) was aimed at preparing Germany for war, and especially to enable Germany blockade proof. Production of raw materials was increased and the materials were distributed on a priority basis to ornament and other war industries. Labour was allotted in a similar fashion, and prices and foreign exchange were manipulated. Germany’s talented scientists were asked to make up for other deficiencies by devising successful but expensive synthetic products. Important in this field were distillation of motor fuel from coal and the production of synthetic rubber.</p>
<p class="indent">The Nazis banned all labour unions in 1933, and employers’ associations in the 1934. Instead, a ‘Labour Front’ was established, including wage earners, salaried persons, professionals, and employers. Strikes and lockouts had been forbidden. Each plant had its own council. This council made recommendations for improvements within the plant. Germany was divided into 13 districts, each under a ‘Trustee of Labour’ who fixed wages, settled disputes, ousted anyone, whether employer or worker, whom he felt were hampering the operation of the labour front. Workers were assured jobs so long as they quietly accepted the entire system. The labour front was in a way a huge spy organisation constantly on the alert for anti-Nazis in the factories. A supplement to the Labour Front was the “Strength through Joy” organisation, which extended paid vacation trips for German workers to resorts or tourists centres and which sponsored concerts and other entertainments.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were its Other Domestic Policies?</b></i></span> Hitler went for thorough reorganisation of the judicial system of Germany. He abandoned traditional legal principles and substituted ‘folk’ justice for German law. People’s courts were set up to try all cases of treason. Hitler appointed all judges of the people’s courts. Concentration camps were created for enemies of the regime. The Gestapo (Secret State Police or SS) was founded in April 1933 in Prussia and a year later was extended to all of Germany. It had handful powers in opening private correspondence, tapping wires and spying on private citizens.</p>
<p class="indent">The Christian Churches of both Protestant and Catholic sects posed a problem for the Nazis. Extremists among Hitler’s followers were keen about returning to paganism. Hitler himself had openly admitted that Germany was his only god. However, office made him sober and made <a id="calibre_link-436" class="calibre10"></a>him keep in mind that Germany was after all nominally a Christian country. The efforts of extreme Nazis to purge the Bible and to discard the crucifix let to dissension. The dissidents led by Pastor Martin Niemoeller protested against Nazi policy and efforts at control. However, Niemoeller not only pledged his loyalty to Hitler, but also made no objections to Nazi racism and went to a concentration camp solely out of determination to resist dictation over the Lutheran Church. Yet, the movement he led was probably confined about only 15 per cent of the Protestant Clergy and the rest compromised with the regime.</p>
<p class="indent">The Nazi process of coordination was applied in every aspect of the national life, including education and the arts. A prominent Nazi official once commented, “When I hear the word culture, I reach for my revolver” &ndash; very typical of the extreme Nazi attitude. Hitler’s own artistic tastes were also simple in the extreme; he preferred nudes &ndash; the more Germanic the better. His tastes were sought to be imposed on the nation, denouncing most of the modern and experimental styles in art as non-Aryan.</p>
<p class="indent">The school curriculum, especially history, was not to be taught with the ‘objectivity’ which was a “Fallacy of Liberalism” but had to be delivered to the student in sync with the Nazi doctrine of “Blood and soil”. Nazi racial doctrines, the exaggerated achievements of Germany, the growth of the military spirit and physical culture &ndash; these were the foundations of the new education.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Foreign Policy?</b></i></span> The Foreign policy of the Nazis was based on the principle of German “Racism” which justified the integration of all territory inhabited by Germans, including Austria, Sudetenland (the Western borderlands) of Czechoslovakia, and the Polish Corridor. The Nazi doctrine of “living space” or “Lebensraum” justified the absorption of non-Germanic areas in the rest of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and all South Eastern Europe as well as large areas of Russia. Hitler thought that what the Germans need, they were entitled to take as they were a superior people.</p>
<p class="indent">The concept of ‘Lebensraum’ comes partly from 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century German intellectuals who nostalgically viewed the Holy Roman Empire of the Middle Ages, the Fist Reich, and aspired, after the World War I broke up the Second Reich of William II, to behold a third empire, including the old territories, no matter who now lived in them. This is the meaning of Hitler’s use of the term ‘Third Reich’ to portray the Nazi stage, which he declared would last a thousand years.</p>
<p class="indent">A theoretical basis for the ‘Lebensraum’ concept was offered by the teacher of ‘geopolitics’, chief among whom was Karl Haushofer, professor of Geography and teacher of Hitler’s close friend, Rudolf Hess. The geo-politicians gave a respectable front for Nazi territorial aspirations. Haushofer proclaimed that Britain and France were degenerate, that small powers should vanish (except for Switzerland and the Vatican city), and that Germany with its racial purity should expand ruthlessly occupying the ‘heart land’ of Eurasia from which the world could be dominated.</p>
<p class="indent">To bolster his claims to more space Hitler often stated that Germany was overcrowded. He himself undertook all steps to increase the overcrowding by subsidising bigger families. Hitler captured power by promising to regain the lost land, viz. the Saar province, which was indispensable to Germany’s industry and agriculture due to its mineral deposits and fertile lands.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How does Nazism Compare with Facism?</b></i></span> It is interesting to make a comparison of the two right wing movements of Europe. German Nazism was in several respects similar to Italian Fascism. Both laid great store by the supremacy of the leader; tried to organise a totalitarian state, controlled industry, agriculture, trade <a id="calibre_link-437" class="calibre10"></a>and the way of life of the people so much so that personal freedom was restricted; violently opposed communism; stressed the close unity of all classes working together to attain their goals; and strove to make the country self-sufficient.</p>
<p class="indent">But the dissimilarities between the two cannot be ignored. Hitler was especially known for his anti-Semitic views from the very beginning, while Mussolini was not particularly anti-Semitic. It was only in 1938 that the latter shared the views of the former mainly in order to come closer to the more powerful ally. Besides, in Italy there was no persecution of Jews comparable to that of Nazi regime. The constitutional positions of Mussolini and Hitler were quite different. The monarchy still remained intact in Italy and though Mussolini usually ignored King Emmanuel, the king proved useful in 1943 when Mussolini’s opponents looked up to him as the head of the state. He was able to declare Mussolini’s dismissal. There was no one in Germany who could dismiss Hitler (monarchy was overthrown immediately after the end of the World War I). Nazism was much more deep-rooted and stronger in Germany than Fascism in Italy. The German system was much more efficient than that in Italy. For, the latter never came anywhere near self-sufficiency and never eliminated unemployment. The Italian system was not as ruthless and brutal as that in Germany and there were no mass atrocities in Italy.</p>

<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">China experienced a nationalist or anti-imperialist movement after World War I. This <a id="calibre_link-438" class="calibre10"></a>was a somewhat surprising event because China was, at least nominally, independent. China entered the war in 1917 with the hope of recovering Shantung province, which had been occupied by the Japanese in 1914. The lost province was not restored by the peacemakers at Versailles leading to demonstrations by students and intellectuals in Peaking. The protests soon spread like wildfire, engulfing other Chinese cities. Merchants too joined by closing their shops. The movement developed into a boycott of Japanese goods and was accompanied by clashes with Japanese residents. The Westerners too became targets of this movement because of their willingness to allow Japan to retain its booty on the mainland. Russia, however, was viewed with sympathy and admiration, because the Soviet government had renounced Czarist special privileges in China, as it did in Turkey and Persia.</p>
<p class="image1"><img class="img_border" src="images/00104.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption">Nazi Germany in 1942</p>
<p class="indent">These upheavals and changes allowed Dr. Sun Yat Sen the opportunity to make a fresh start with new policies and methods. After appealing in vain for aid from western powers to counter the provincial warlords who were behaving like independent potentates, Dr. Sun turned to the Soviet government for help. A positive response was given leading to the Kuomintang-Communist Entente that began in 1921 and lasted till 1927. Dr. Sun and the able Russian representative, Mikhail Borodin, together brought about three basic changes; they remodelled the Kuomintang Party along communist lines, organised a modern and efficient army, and developed a more effective and appealing political ideology.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1925, Sun Yat Sen died at a time when the fruits of his labour were just ready. He did not live to see the warlords humbled and the country united. He is now recognised, both by Chinese communists and Taiwan Nationalists, as one of the creators of modern China. After Dr. Sun’s death, Chiang Kai Shek became the leading figure in the Kuomintang. In May 1926, he assumed charge of the ‘Northern Expedition’, a campaign to unify China by suppressing the northern warlords.</p>
<p class="indent">These Kuomintang forces, preceded by propaganda corps that included Chinese Communists, swept everything before them reaching the Yangtze by October. The capital was moved to Hankow, which was dominated by left-wing and communist elements, the Chinese Communist Party having been organised in.</p>
<p class="indent">These military victories precipitated a split within the Kuomintang between the left-wing in Hankow and the right-wing under Chiang. Chiang was against Socialist Revolution and advocated nationalism. He had become alarmed by the activities of the leftist propaganda corps that had been operating ahead of his divisions. This propaganda worked among the workers and peasants, stirring them up against the landed gentry, the urban bourgeoisie and the western business interests. Chiang worked closely with Russian advisors, but nevertheless, he was strongly anti-communist and determined to prevent the leftists from gaining control of the party.</p>
<p class="indent">Chiang, therefore, carried out a bloody purge of communists and their leftist allies with help from the conservative elements within the Kuomintang and the financial interests in Shanghai. Borodin returned to Russia, and Chiang reorganised Kuomintang so that he was the undisputed leader. In June 1928, his armies took Peking, thereby breaking the hold of the northern warlords and completing the country’s unification. China’s new capital became Nanking.</p>
<p class="indent">In the next decade, appreciable progress was made. Railway mileage almost doubled, and that of modern roads quadrupled. Internal tariff barriers were abolished in 1932 and unified currency created for the first time. Commendable progress was also achieved in governmental procedures, in public health, in education and in industrialisation. Striking <a id="calibre_link-439" class="calibre10"></a>success was achieved in the diplomatic field too. Control of the tariff was regained, some of the territories ceded to foreign nations were recovered and many of the special privileges enjoyed by the West were returned; extra-territorial rights were surrendered by all foreign nations by 1943.</p>
<p class="indent">Chiang’s reform program had some serious gaps which proved fatal ultimately. Essential land reforms were neglected because the Kuomintang in the countryside was dominated by landlords who opposed change. Chiang was authoritarian and his one-party government prevented the growth of democracy. All opposition was suppressed with no constitutional means provided for groups to express opinions. In this situation, revolution was the only alternative. The Kuomintang failed to develop ideas that could attract the people’s support. Nationalist appeals had little appeal for land hungry peasants and poverty-stricken city workers.</p>
<p class="indent">These weaknesses of the Kuomintang regime may have been overcome if it had been given a longer period of peace. The communists at home and Japanese abroad made this impossible. The Communist Party in China was organised in July 1921 at Shanghai and branches were soon opened all over the country. Many students and intellectuals joined, attracted by the call for action and the assurance of a classless and equitable society for the future.</p>
<p class="indent">The communists first cooperated with Sun Yat Sen and then broke with Chiang Kai Shek in 1927. Many of the early communist leaders were killed by Gen. Chiang, but some managed to escape to the mountainous interior of South China. Mao Tse Tung was one of their leaders. He worked out a revolutionary strategy in defiance of the Communist International in Moscow. He rejected the traditional Marxist doctrine that only the urban proletariat could be depended on to carry through a revolution. He concluded from first hand observation in the countryside that the poor peasants, who constituted 70 per cent of the population, were ‘the vanguard of the revolution.’ This was heresy according to Moscow, but Mao went his way, organising the peasants and building up a separate army and government in the south.</p>
<p class="indent">Chiang responded to this threat by launching five ‘Bandit Extermination Campaigns’. The communists, however, managed to survive, thanks to the support of the peasants who were won over by the communist policy of dividing large estates without compensation to the owners. The fifth campaign succeeded in dislodging the communists, who were completely surrounded by the Kuomintang armies. Eventually, 90,000 communists managed to break through. Of these, less than 7,000 survived a 6000-mile trek of tremendous hardship, popularly known as the ‘Long March.’ The survivors finally reached the northwest provinces, where they dug in and set up base. Once again, their land reform policies stood them in good stead and won them peasant support which enabled them to build up strength to the point where they became serious rivals of the Kuomintang regime in Nanking.</p>
<p class="indent">While these domestic problems and skirmishes with the communists were taking place, Chiang faced a challenge from the Japanese. The aggression began with the occupation of Manchuria in 1931 and continued until the end of the World War II. By the beginning of the World War II, the Japanese were in control of the entire eastern seaboard. This combination of communist subversion and Japanese aggression proved too much for Chiang and in 1949 he fled to Taiwan, leaving Mao to rule the mainland from Peking, the new capital.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Anti-Imperialist Movements</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did they Rise?</b></i></span> The ‘cutting of the Chinese melon’ or the dismemberment of the Chinese Empire by the foreign powers was the primary cause for the rise of nationalist movement in China. It was accomplished by the foreign <a id="calibre_link-440" class="calibre10"></a>powers in two stages. During the first phase (1860&ndash;95), the Celestial Empire was trimmed of its fringes, i.e., China lost her tribute paying kingdoms. For example, it lost Burma to Britain in 1886, Indo-China to France in 1885, and Korea to Japan in 1895. During the second phase (1895&ndash;1914), the mainland of China itself got carved up into spheres of influence under the control of foreign powers. In this process of ‘cutting the Chinese melon’, Great Britain, France and Russia, and later Japan took the lead.</p>
<p class="indent">The uninhibited economic exploitation of China by foreign powers, first through the Treaty Port System and later through the finance capital, was equally responsible for the rise of nationalist movement in China. The Treaty Ports soon became areas through which the imperialist powers influenced China’s economic and commercial life. Foreign trade of China increased by more than six times between 1850 and 1900. This had serious impact on the Chinese economy, since the import of machine-made foreign goods far exceeded her exports. The Chinese markets began to be flooded with the machine-made foreign goods and they were sold at much cheaper rates. This naturally crippled the growth of indigenous industries, which in turn caused large-scale unemployment and economic dislocation.</p>
<p class="indent">One more main cause for the rise of nationalist movement in China, was the activities and behaviour of Christian missionaries in China, which hurt the religious and social sentiments of the traditional minded Chinese. The Christian missionaries obtained a legal status in the Chinese empire by the Toleration Clause of the Tientsin Treaties of 1858. Fortified by these clauses, many missionaries tried to throw their mantle of protection around the local converts. The common man was hostile as he was suspicious of Christianity, which clashed with fundamental concepts of Chinese social and religious life. This suspicion and distrust sometimes led the people to make lives and properties of missionaries their targets.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet, we cannot ignore the positive contribution made by the missionaries for the betterment of China. Among them there were many who were sincere and permeated with the spirit of humanity. They played an important role in enlarging China’s relation with the outside world. They introduced western medicine, spread education of western type by establishing schools and colleges, and circulated western literature containing western ideas, including that of nationalism.</p>
<p class="indent">The Chinese in general resented the ill-treatment of Chinese in foreign legations and treaty ports in China itself. Chinese students who had gone to the USA and the European countries were often looked down and ill-treated.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, the Chinese were quite unhappy by the ruthless exploitation of the Chinese workers by the foreigners through the so-called ‘pig-trade’. Thus, the gradual subordination of China to the Imperialist powers in all fields &ndash; political, economic, social and religious &ndash; was strongly resented by the Chinese. As a result, they rose in a nationalist movement starting with the Boxer Uprising and ending with the triumph of the communists in mainland China.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is Boxer Movement?</b></i></span> A wave of resentment against any compromise with the West swept the country which at its height is known as the ‘Boxer Uprising’ (1899&ndash;1901). It was an attempt to overthrow the foreigners out of the land with all their hated ideas. It was not just a sudden outburst against the missionaries. It was an attempt to oppose the policy of any type of contact with the West. Practically, the entire North China stood behind the movement. It was also supported by many high-ranking people of the country. The Boxers cried ‘protect China and destroy foreigners’.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-441" class="calibre10"></a>Hence, it was not just an anti-Christian but an anti-foreign movement as well.</p>
<p class="indent">The origin of the movement was complex in nature. The popular and spontaneous opposition to the foreigners found expression in the establishment of traditional form of societies with religious features which offered the protection of magic against western bullets. A secret society, known as the ‘Eight Diagram Society’, had been active since 1770. During the troubled days of the 1890’s one of its probable off-shoots, ‘Fists of Righteous Harmony’, became active. This title together with the gymnastic exercises practiced by its members won for them the name of Boxers. Their rituals based on popular Taoist magic impressed the common people. The Boxers were at first local groups organised to destroy Chinese Christians. In areas such as Shantung, where the government encouraged the organisation of militia to resist the Germans, the Boxers by infiltration acquired a semi-official encouragement. They became the core of a desperate anti-foreign movement.</p>
<p class="indent">Majority of the Boxers came from poor disgruntled peasantry, disbanded soldiers and the riff-raff of the society. They were essentially against the aristocracy, and wanted to attack the landlords and corrupt government officials. The local government officials (mandarins) cleverly manipulated them and diverted their attacks against foreigners. The Boxers were persuaded to believe that the cause of their poverty and suffering was the presence of foreigners in China.</p>
<p class="indent">The Boxers were, therefore, anti-foreign and anti-Christian, but not anti-Manchu. The churches, banks, the railways, educational institutions and the hospitals constructed by the foreigners were attacked and destroyed. They also attacked the Chinese Christians who came to be considered as the agents of the foreigners. Pro-western Chinese too were not spared.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Take Place?</b></i></span> The Empress Dowager, Tsu-Hsi, incited the Boxer rebels, though tacitly, and was happy to see the foreigners in real trouble. Emboldened by the support of the Empress, the Boxers attacked foreign legations in Peking where the foreigners used to live. Being alarmed with rapid spread of such violence, the foreign ministers at Peking strongly urged the Chinese government for the immediate dissolution of all secret societies. As the Chinese government did not respond favourably to their request, the foreign ministers asked their respective governments to dispatch naval squadrons to China. The arrival of these squadrons merely whipped up anti-foreign sentiment. Matters came to a head when the Chancellor of the Japanese Legation and the German envoy were murdered. The newly arrived fleet seized the forts which commanded the river approach to Tientsin to ensure access to that city for the safeguarding of foreigners there and in Peking.</p>
<p class="indent">After a stormy session of the Chinese Grand Council, a formal declaration of war against the foreigners was made. The southern provinces remained aloof and ignored this declaration of war on the ground that it had not received the Emperor’s sanction.</p>
<p class="indent">The declaration of war did not amount to much and the formal warfare remained practically limited to the seize of legations, and their relief by an allied army. An international army of seven nations was raised and it marched from Tientsin, and within 10 days took control of Peking. The Empress and other members of the royal family fled from Peking, leaving the Chinese government and the capital at the mercy of the foreigners.</p>
<p class="indent">After prolonged negotiations, the victorious powers (11 in number by this time) signed with China the settlement known as the Boxer Protocol (1901), the last of the Chinese treaties in the humiliating 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century tradition. By the <a id="calibre_link-442" class="calibre10"></a>terms of the agreement, China agreed among other things to:</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(1)</span>make a formal and general apology.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(2)</span>offer regrets to Germany and pay a special indemnity to Japan.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(3)</span>pay a large indemnity of 450 million taels secured on the maritime customs and the salt <i class="calibre8">gabelle</i>.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(4)</span>punish the Boxer leaders.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(5)</span>suspend for five years all competitive examinations for administrative purposes in Boxer towns.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(6)</span>permit the establishment of permanent legation guards in Peking.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(7)</span>revise commercial treaties.</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="space">(8)</span>accept military occupation of strategic points between the capital and the sea.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Outcome?</b></i></span> The results of the failure of the movement and the subsequent <a id="calibre_link-443" class="calibre10"></a>treaty were quite far-reaching. China emerged with an enhanced debt and added humiliation. Instead of strengthening, the uprising hastened the end of the Manchu dynasty, and paved the way for the successful Revolution of 1911 and the establishment of the Republic. China was almost relegated to the position of a subject nation, and for the next quarter of a century, the victorious westerners almost assumed the attitude of conquerors in a vassal state, which could not but be humiliating to proud people.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00131.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Area of Boxer Movement</p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, the movement saved the country from partition and outright annexation by foreign powers. Though the Boxers were mainly guided by a policy of blind hatred and had no constructive program, their resentment against foreign intrusion and exploitation was so intense that the foreigners were forced to stop the dismemberment of China, and that she emerged with her independence guaranteed, if restricted. Several factors ranging from the mutual jealousies of the powers which might involve them in the possibility of a large-scale conflict over the division of China, to a recognition that the ‘spheres of influence’ were more profitable than outright annexation were responsible for this. Its failure also set off an era of conservative reform in an attempt to infuse some vigour into the decadent system.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Importance of 1911 Revolution?</b></i></span> The Nationalist Revolution of 1911 was led by nationalists like Dr. Sun Yat Sen, Liang Chi Chao, Tung Meng Hue, etc. The twin objectives of the revolution were: to free China from the economic and political domination of the foreigners and to see the end of the Manchu dynasty which was an obstacle in the modernisation of China.</p>
<p class="indent">The revolutionary nationalists finally succeeded in occupying 13 provinces and proclaimed it as a Republic with Nanking as its capital. Dr. Sun Yat Sen became its president. North China was still under the control of the Manchus. The Manchus, with the intention of fortifying their authority, recalled General Yuan Shi Kai to assume the reigns at this crucial juncture.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00014.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Dr. Sun Yat Sen</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Sun Yat Sen, showing self-sacrifice and courage, telegraphed to Yuan offering him the presidency of the Republic after the abdication of the Manchu emperor, if Yuan accepted the Republican constitution. Ultimately, Yuan made the Emperor to abdicate the throne and he became the president of the first Republic of China.</p>
<p class="indent">The Revolution of 1911 was anti-imperialist, because it was the work of Chinese nationalists who strongly resented the humiliation and ruthless economic exploitation of their country by imperialist powers. It was also anti-Manchu, because it ousted the Manchu rulers who were held responsible for humiliation and exploitation of China by the imperialist countries. It was even anti-traditional, since it represented an attempt on the part of the Chinese nationalists to put aside traditionalism, which was thought to be responsible for the sad plight of China, in favour of modernism through which they hoped to stem the imperialist aggression.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did the may Fourth Movement Happen?</b></i></span> May Fourth Movement (1919&ndash;1921) was the direct result of the aggressive activities of Japan which occupied the Kiachow Bay and the Shantung province and served the notorious 21 demands on China, and the refusal of the imperialist powers to redress genuine grievances of China at the Versailles Peace Conference. By serving the 21 demands on China, Japan wanted to exercise her control <a id="calibre_link-444" class="calibre10"></a>over the Southern Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. This was naturally resented by the Chinese nationalists, and strong anti-Japanese sentiments swept the country. The failure of the Chinese delegation at Versailles to recover the German rights and leased territory in Shantung province, which had been taken over by Japan, completely disillusioned the Chinese nationalists about the motives of the West. They had believed in the declared war aims of the Allies that they were fighting to end all future wars and for democracy and self-determination of all people. The Chinese felt that they had been betrayed by the West.</p>
<p class="indent">The denial of China’s just aspirations roused national spirit and led to anti-imperialist demonstrations in which the students took an active part. On 4<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> May 1919, students of Peaking University staged a strong demonstration against the action of the imperialist countries. This protest march of May 4<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> developed into the May Fourth Movement. Hundreds of students denounced the Chinese diplomats, who failed to uphold the national honour, and demanded the abolition of unequal treaties and the protection of the sovereignty of their nation. They shouted slogans like ‘boycott of Japanese goods.’ When Japan protested to this, the students changed the slogan and shouted ‘purchase Chinese goods only’.</p>
<p class="indent">The May Fourth Movement is significant because it represented the growing anti-imperialist sentiment of the Chinese. During the movement, the merchants co-operated with the students and showed willingness to make economic sacrifices. The sacrifices of the business community and the mobilisation of almost the whole nation on such a large-scale revealed the growth of nationalism and anti-imperialism.</p>
<p class="indent">The results of this movement were quite far-reaching. It played a great role in modernising the country and contributed largely to the rise of student and labour movements, the reorganisation of the Kuomintang and the birth of the Chinese Communist Party. It bolstered the growth of a new vernacular literature and facilitated the rapid spread of popular education. It also hastened the decline of the old order including traditionalism, Confucianism and the old family system. In other words, it marked the birth of modern China. Finally, the intensity of the movement made the western imperialist countries realise that they must do something to pacify the wounded feelings of the Chinese. This realisation was to a great extent responsible for the convening of the Washington Conference (1922) in which some of the Chinese grievances were redressed.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Role of KMT and CCP in the Final Stage?</b></i></span> The Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) formed the “First United Front” (1922&ndash;27) in order to meet the imperialist threat and free China of all foreign control. The KMT and the CCP formed this alliance despite their major policy differences on the home front, because both parties felt that it was first necessary to free China of imperialist control if China were to develop in all fields at home. Dr. Sun Yat Sen, who was the head of the KMT till his death in 1925, was more of a nationalist than an anti-communist. He was in fact very impressed by the progress made by the Soviet Union under the communists. Thee CCP was greatly influenced at this time by the Soviet Communist Party and the Comintern (Communist International) which followed the policy that the communists in all the suppressed nations should cooperate with the nationalists there in order to remove all foreign control. The abrogation of all the unequal treaties in 1927&ndash;28 was the result of the coordinated efforts of the KMT and the CCP.</p>
<p class="indent">The sudden demise of Dr. Sun Yat Sen and the succession of Chiang Kai Shek in 1925, however, caused difficulties in the cooperation between the KMT and the CCP and finally it broke down in 1927, because Chiang was more worried about the spread of communism in <a id="calibre_link-445" class="calibre10"></a>China rather than the domination of China by the imperialist countries.</p>
<p class="indent">Once again the KMT and the CCP came together in 1937 to form the Second United Front (1937&ndash;45) in order to put up a strong front against the Imperialist Japan which was at that time going through the highest stage of imperialism and militarism. In the formation of this second united front, Mao played the most important role. Mao, who became the undisputed leader of the CCP after the great Long March, believed that revolution should be carried on two fronts &ndash; against the landlords on the home front and against imperialist countries at the international level. When Japan increased her imperialist aggressive activities against China, Mao put aside his differences with the KMT and forced Chiang to cooperate with him in defending China. It was, in fact, due to this cooperation that China was able to put up strong resistance to Japan during the Second World War. The defeat of Japan in the Second World War, and the success of the communists in the civil war (1945&ndash;49) against the KMT and the final establishment of the People’s Republic of China by the communists in 1949 marked the end of the anti-imperialist movement in China.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Communist Revolution</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Take Place?</b></i></span> China suffered immensely due to the unashamed economic exploitation perpetuated by the imperialist powers in China and the social as well as political humiliation heaped on it by these powers throughout the second half of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and the first half of the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. This exploitation and humiliation came to be resented by almost all sections of the Chinese society, who felt that this sad plight of China was due to the feudal nature of her economy, society and polity. Hence they wanted to bring about drastic changes in these spheres.</p>
<p class="indent">The Kuomintang government led by Chiang Kai Shek, which consisted of mainly capitalists and landlords failed to offer and implement a suitable program to improve the economic condition of the poorer sections of the society. It also failed to control the rising inflation of the 1930s which further worsened the condition of the common people.</p>
<p class="indent">The emergence of the Communist Party of China, under the effective leadership of Mao, who seemed to offer a dynamic, forward looking and above all inspiring leadership, caught the imagination of the Chinese people.</p>
<p class="indent">The successful Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent advancement of the Soviet Union provided a great source of inspiration for the people of China. The Soviet assistance also, though materially limited, morally mattered a lot.</p>
<p class="indent">Prof. Li Tao Chao and Chen Tu Hsiu of Peking University organised the first Marxist study group in China in 1918. Chen Tu Hsiu with the assistance of the Soviet communists founded the nucleus of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in September 1920.</p>
<p class="indent">Mao Tse Tung, Liu Shao Chi, Chou En Lai and Chu Teh were among the founder members of the CCP. The goal of the CCP was the establishment of the dictatorship of the workers and the peasants.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Early Relations of CCP and KMT?</b></i></span> The CCP initially maintained close contact with the Soviet Union, whose decision in the early twenties was to cooperate with the nationalists, and hence its directive to the CCP to cooperate with the Kuomintang (KMT) made the CCP a junior partner of the KMT. As a result, the communists formed the First United Front with the KMT and collaborated with the nationalists between 1923 and 1927. During this period of collaboration, the communists increased their strength by enrolling new members and by developing their military and <a id="calibre_link-446" class="calibre10"></a>party organisation. Then came the split in 1927 with the KMT when Chiang’s forces dealt the severest blow to the communists.</p>
<p class="indent">Between 1927 and 1930, the CCP led a series of unsuccessful revolts against the KMT government. An abortive army uprising in August 1927 was followed by an equally fruitless peasant uprising in Hunan in early September under the leadership of Mao. While the continued failure of these uprisings discredited Chen Tu Hsiu, the Secretary General of the party, and other leaders, Mao retreated to Kiangsi to establish the first Chinese Soviet there in 1931. With the aid of Chu Teh, the nucleus of the Chinese Red Army was also formed there. From the time of its inception, Chiang’s forces launched the ‘encirclement campaigns’ against the newly founded Soviet for its complete destruction. A total of five such campaigns were launched between December 1930 and October 1934.</p>
<p class="indent">In the fifth and final campaign Chiang assembled about 7 lakh troops against the communists. He combined his massive offensive with an economic blockade. The methods of this offensive were changed this time. In the earlier campaigns, KMT troops had made quick and deep thrusts into communist held territory in Kiangsi. But against the determined communist resistance they could not maintain their position. This time, however, Chiang adopted new methods upon the advice of his German counsellors. The methods used this time resembled the tactics used in North America against the Red Indians. The military pressure and the blockade had the desired effect. The position of the communists became precarious and in October 1934, they broke out of the encirclement and moved away from Kiangsi.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Long March?</b></i></span> The breakthrough of communists from their siege by the KMT forces resulted in the famous ‘Long March’ (1934) during which the communists and their supporters covered a distance of more than 6,000 miles on foot over incredibly difficult terrain. The memorable march took slightly more than a year. In spite of the difficulties of the terrain, the average daily distance covered during the march was 24 miles. It was all the more creditable, as besides the difficulties of the terrain, the communist army had with it many families of its supporters and it was all along harassed by KMT forces and the armies of the local landlords. Moreover, besides continuous skirmishes they had to fight over 15 major battles on the way.</p>
<p class="indent">All through the long distance covered during the march, the communists tried to spread their ideas in the cities and the rural areas along which they moved. They held mass meetings with political speeches and theatrical performances for the purpose. In the process they were able to win over many peasants and other poorer sections of the society to their cause.</p>
<p class="indent">The communists had to incur great military losses during the march. Though about one lakh persons had left the Soviet of Kiangsi and many poor people joined them on the way, only about 7000 men reached North-western Shensi. The Long March revealed the resiliency of the CCP and the inadequacies of the KMT which later proved fatal to the KMT.</p>
<p class="indent">The areas through which the communists had marched were mostly under the control of the local warlords. In their battles with the communists, the warlords suffered considerable losses that made easier the task of the KMT to establish control over these areas. Thus, it helped the nationalists to consolidate their hold over many areas where previously they had no real footing. On the other hand, it taught the communist forces new techniques of guerrilla warfare that later proved helpful to them during the periods of Japanese aggression and civil war with the KMT.</p>
<p class="indent">Within the CCP also the Long March had important effects. Mao, who was already the Chairman of the Soviet of Republic of Kiangsi, ultimately emerged as the undisputed leader of the party.</p>

<p class="caption">Long March by Chinese Communists</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Shensi Soviet?</b></i></span> At Shensi, the communist forces established their new headquarters. The territory controlled by them was mainly south of the Great Wall in the Northern part of Shensi and in the North-eastern portion of Kansul. The area where they settled was well-known for its maladministration and oppressive taxation by local warlords. By judicious administrative and agrarian reforms they were able to repeat here the success of the Kiangsi Soviet.</p>
<p class="indent">In the areas controlled by them, called ‘Liberated Areas’, all prices were brought under state control and commodity prices were drastically lowered. They conscripted young men of the area and built the Red Army. By their seizure of property and conscription of young men, the communists had earlier become unpopular with the middle class in the Kiangsi Soviet. In order to avoid creating enemies this time, the communists instituted less stringent reform programs when they moved to Shensi. Instead of widespread seizure of land, they adopted a program of progressive taxation, and rent and credit controls. Assemblies elected by popular vote were created. To show their moderation, they took only one third seats in all governing bodies, though they were able to <a id="calibre_link-448" class="calibre10"></a>control them effectively through their superior organisation and discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why was the Second United Front Formed?</b></i></span> The CCP took a serious objection to the Japanese attack on Manchuria and declared war against Japanese in February 1932. They held anti-Japanese mass meetings and aroused the popular hatred against them to a fever pitch. To resist Japan, they also proposed cooperation with the KMT. Chiang turned down their appeal and withstood the pressure of the ardent nationalists for a joint defence of the country.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultimately in December 1936, he was taken prisoner by his own men who demanded among other things the acceptance of the communist proposal for a united front and strong resistance to Japan. For some time, Chiang’s life appeared to be in danger, but early in 1937 a settlement was reached with the communists about a united national front. Thus, after the ‘Sian Incident’, Chiang was forced to agree to the formation of the Second United Front, and throughout the war with Japan an uneasy truce existed between the CCP and the KMT.</p>
<p class="indent">With the Japanese advancement into China and occupation of vast part of the country, the communist and nationalist guerrillas remained behind the tightly held Japanese areas. The communists, however, were better organised and experienced to continue guerrilla activities. They, therefore, were more successful in harassing the Japanese. These successes enabled them to absorb the nationalist guerrillas into their own organisation. By the time of Japanese surrender, the communist-controlled ‘liberated areas’ had a population of about 10 crores.</p>
<p class="indent">In spite of an earlier understanding that the Red Army should be reorganised under Chiang’s authority, the communists kept control of their military formations throughout the war with Japan. The Red Army was imparted intensive political indoctrination and continued to grow and perfect its tactics under the leadership of Chu Teh. For maximum flexibility and efficiency, their army was divided into three parts &ndash; the regular troops, the well trained guerrilla forces and loose formations of peasant militia. By the close of the war, the communist armed forces had increased formidably from 80,000 in 1937 to about 13 million. Thus, on the eve of Japanese surrender the CCP was ready to fill the vacuum with a large well-doctrinated army, efficient party machine and by popular slogans of land redistribution and agrarian reform.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did the Civil War Break Out?</b></i></span> Even when the United Front of the CCP and the KMT was resisting the Japanese, the two parties were suspicious of each other. In January, 1941, a serious clash occurred between the communists and the nationalists in Southern Anhwei. The pressing demands of the Japanese war, however, temporarily reconciled them, but as the defeat of Japan became imminent, the two parties again began preparations for the final showdown. Encouraged by the Soviet Union’s declaration of war against Japan, Chu Teh ordered the Red Army to grab as much territory as possible. Chiang was shrewd enough to see in it a communist plan to capture power and ordered Chu Teh to withdraw his order. When Chu ignored his order, clashes started between the nationalists and the communists.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was USA’S Role in it?</b></i></span> The United States which had helped the nationalist government with huge sums now stepped in and urged both the parties to continue the war-time front for the reconstruction of the war-torn country. The American initiative seemingly succeeded for the time being and the two parties arrived at an agreement by which they consented to call a political consultative conference for deciding the future of China.</p>
<p class="indent">Even when these negotiations were going on, the clashes continued on an ever-increasing scale and the nationalist government decided to mount full scale offensive against the <a id="calibre_link-449" class="calibre10"></a>communists. The USA once again intervened with the same limited success.</p>
<p class="indent">By the close of 1945, President Truman sent General George C. Marshall to act as mediator. Though Marshall succeeded in bringing the hostile parties to a conference table, nothing concrete could be achieved. The nationalists, who had regained military control over China’s most important strategic centres after Japan’s defeat and who were convinced that the USA could not afford to let communism triumph in China, refused to make any substantial concessions to the communists. The communists, being confident of their strength and enraged by continued American aid to the nationalists also showed stiff attitude in the conference. Marshall acknowledged his failure in August 1946, and left for USA.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Take Place?</b></i></span> The capitulation of Japan set off the race between the nationalists and the communists to take over the areas evacuated by Japan. Massive hostilities began in Manchuria and North China. The nationalists who had a large armed force obtained considerable success in the opening phases of the struggle. They swept through the north-west and even occupied the old communist stronghold of Yunan in Shensi. These victories, however, did not break the spirit of the communists, and though they were driven out of the cities, they retained control of the countryside and continued to harass the nationalist forces whose lines of communication were over-stretched and became increasingly vulnerable. The Red Army which now called itself the ‘People’s Army’ began a strong counter-offensive and the nationalist army began to crumble before it when many of their units surrendered to the communists. Despite the generous help of the USA to the nationalists, the communists became the masters of the entire mainland of China, while the remnants of the nationalist forces under Chiang fled to Formosa (Taiwan).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did the Communists Win?</b></i></span> The somewhat unexpected victory of the CCP over the KMT in the civil war was largely due to the latter’s fierce internal conflicts as well as to the weaknesses and corruption of its leaders. When the Japanese occupied the urban and industrial areas of China, most of the capitalists retired to the interior and they lost their previous powers and influence over the party which was usurped by the landed gentry. Under their leadership, the KMT became anti-capitalist not in a Marxist, but in a pre-industrial sense. This retrogressive attitude antagonised the intelligentsia as well as the middle classes which were the main supporters of the KMT. After the fall of Japan, when the nationalists became the rulers of China, they were led by an unimaginative small-minded rural landlord leadership who earned notoriety by their corruption and inefficiency. They were unable to offer and implement a suitable program to improve the condition of the poorer sections of the society, the peasantry and the workers. The galloping inflation, for which the KMT misrule was held responsible, further undermined the popularity of the party. Its armies were poorly paid and were allowed to loot the countryside. Subjected to communist propaganda, they gradually became disillusioned with Chiang and began to desert to the communists. Towards the end, Chiang also made some tactical blunders; like Hitler he could not bear to order retreats and consequently his scattered armies were surrounded and often, as at Peking and Shanghai, surrendered without resistance, totally disillusioned.</p>
<p class="indent">The communists, in contrast, continued to win popular support by their restrained land policy which varied according to the needs of particular areas; some or all of a landlord’s estates might be confiscated and redistributed among the peasants, or there might simply be rent restriction. Besides, communists were well disciplined, and communist administration <a id="calibre_link-450" class="calibre10"></a>was honest and scrupulously fair. Finally, the CCP leaders, Mao and Chou En Lai, were shrewd enough to take advantage of KMT weaknesses and were completely dedicated. The communist generals Chu Teh, Lin Piao and Chen Yi, had prepared their armies carefully and were more competent tactically than their KMT counterparts.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was MAO’S Role in it?</b></i></span> After successfully leading his men from Kiangsi Soviet to the Shensi Soviet, he became the undisputed leader of the CCP and was elected its chairman in 1935. From the new base at Shensi, he continued to dominate the strategies of the CCP. The theoretical justification for CCP’s tactics was provided by Mao in a series of speeches, essays and handbooks written in a style at once hard hitting, elegant and authoritative. One of the most important of these was the ‘New Democracy’. He formulated his idea of ‘New Democracy’ to show how the communists would rule China. It was moderate in outlook. He argued that economically China was not yet sufficiently developed for complete socialistic rule and pleaded for a mixed economy of state-owned, private and cooperative enterprises. Land to be distributed with equal shares was the ideal. He further advocated a coalition government of the party, proletariat, peasantry and national bourgeoisie to administer the New Democracy in the first stage. After the elimination of feudalism and imperialism in the first stage, the ultimate aim of establishing socialism was expected to be achieved in the next stage.</p>
<p class="indent">From his idea of New Democracy, we can glean some of the basic features of his leadership. They were pragmatism, right strategy, appeal to Chinese nationalism, etc. His policy of pragmatism, as opposed to rigid dogmatism and attuning Marxism to the special conditions of China won him considerable support both <a id="calibre_link-451" class="calibre10"></a>within and without the CCP. A large number of middle class intellectuals who could not see any hope for China’s regeneration under the KMT regime gradually shifted their allegiance to Mao’s doctrines. The reversal of previous ‘Closed Door’ policy of the party leadership by Mao also enabled the progressive intellectuals to rally round him.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Significance of Chinese Communism?</b></i></span> The significance of the rise and establishment of communism in China lies in the fact that it has given a new dimension to international communism, both in theory and practice, by demonstrating that Communist Revolution is possible not only in the industrialised or at least semi-industrialised countries but also in countries with predominantly agrarian based economies like China. It also demonstrated that Communist Revolution can be successfully brought about even with peasants forming the main force. Hitherto, it was believed that only the industrial workers can and, in fact, should form the vanguard (main force) of a communist revolution. Finally, by joining the hitherto lone communist country of the world, viz. USSR, China has given strength to international communism.</p>

<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Serbian hatred of Austria-Hungary was the spark that soon exploded into World War I. Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary was assassinated by Serbian nationalists as he visited Sarajevo in the Austrian province of Bosnia. Austria-Hungary demanded that the guilty persons be punished. Serbia, getting assurance of Russian support if attacked, would not agree directly. France and Britain assured Russia of support. On July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Germany pressurised Austria to negotiate, but Russia began to mobilise her troops, sending many to the German border. Germany warned Russia to stop this troops’ build-up. The French response to a German request for neutrality was to mobilise. Germany called up its troops and, when Russia still refused to pull its troops from the border, declared war on Russia. Believing France would march to the aid of Russia, Germany declared war on France and marched across Belgium. England having already agreed to protect the French sea coast, now declared war on Germany. On August 6, Austria-Hungary declared war on Russia. Germany, Austria&ndash;Hungary and Turkey faced Russia, France, England and Italy. The World War which no one really wanted was under way.</p>
<p class="indent">Nationalism, imperialism and secret alliances had made every major power suspicious and jealous of others. Every nation, including the smallest, was willing to fight whenever a question of its honour was at stake. When <a id="calibre_link-456" class="calibre10"></a>every nation tried to take some land or a colony away from the others, honour was always in question. France wanted to take revenge on Germany for its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870&ndash;1871, and its loss of the border areas of Alsace-Lorraine. Austria-Hungary resented Russia’s growing influence in the Balkan states. England felt threatened by German’s new battleship fleet. Italy resented Austria-Hungary from the days before its unification. Russia wanted to be more influential in European affairs, and Germany thought England and France were trying to curb its growing power.</p>
<p class="indent">The fight for colonies and the resulting incidents convinced many that only military power could solve their problems. Nations, fearing each other, were linked by secret treaties that dragged all of Europe into the ‘Great War’. Germany, realising France was its most dangerous enemy, had marched across Belgium to strike before France could carry out its plans. The powerful German advance was stopped on the outskirts of Paris itself.</p>
<p class="indent">The German army raced the British-French army westward toward the Channel, in an attempt to encircle Paris. When both armies reached the English Channel at the same time, the war of mobility was over, and both sides began digging trenches. Frontal attacks against enemy trenches were usually thrown back with terrible losses. Massive artillery shelling and poison gas made each attack even more costly. On the eastern front, Russia rushed its poorly trained, badly armed troops into East Prussia and Austria. Although it held its own against Austria-Hungary, Russia suffered disastrous defeats against the German army.</p>
<p class="indent">When the war began, the United States declared itself neutral. As the war progressed, America grew more sympathetic to the Allied cause and became closely tied to the financing and war efforts of England and France. America was also becoming angry about German submarine warfare tactics. Attempting to close England off from the sources of supplies, Germany set out to sink all shipping around the British Isles. As American citizens lost their lives in the sinking, President Woodrow Wilson sent protest notes to the Germans. Finally in April 1917, the US joined the war.</p>
<p class="indent">The ever-building power of America’s forces turned the tide in the west and after a series of German mutinies and uprisings, Kaiser fled to Holland, and Germany sued for peace. An armistice was signed on November 11, 1918. The leaders of the victorious Allied Powers met in Paris in 1919 to draw up the final peace treaty ending World War I. Germany, which had agreed to peace on the basis of the 14 points set out by President Wilson, expected to take part in the treaty negotiations. Instead, the Allied leaders treated Germany as if it were a conquered territory.</p>
<p class="indent">Though Woodrow Wilson had set forth his 14 points as ideals for lasting peace, the other Allied leaders, Lloyd George of England, Clemenceau of France and Orlando of Italy, soon made it clear that they were there to punish Germany and not to seek an ideal peace.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, Germany’s industrial areas, the Rhineland, Saar, and Upper Silesia, were given to Allied Powers. Other German territory was given to Denmark, Poland, France, and Belgium. The Allies also shared the colonies. Germany was to pay billions of dollars to the Allies for war damages and to give up its shipping and much of its remaining coal production. Austria&ndash;Hungary was divided into four small states: Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. Other Austro-Hungarian territory was given to Italy, Greece, Rumania, and Poland. The Turkish Empire was cut up, its territories taken over by England and France. Even Russia, forced to quit the war early, was punished, losing territory to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Rumania, and Finland.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-457" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Take Place?</b></i></span> Nationalism, especially the negative type, was one of the basic causes of the war. In its early stages, nationalism was an apparently harmless idealistic movement by which state governments were formed so that boundaries of nationalities might coincide with those of political groups. The driving force was primarily defense and self-expression. Nationalism gradually acquired, prominently, aggressive features. Patriotism was glorified as the ideal in churches, in educational institutions and other cultural activities. Narrow and intolerant patriotism shadowed sensible and tolerant moves for the promotion of international good will. The worship of the state by the citizen body enabled unscrupulous leaders to pursue dangerous aggressive policies under the guise of patriotism. Unrestrained nationalism made compromise between states exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, and furnished loyalty for the state and a hatred for the foreigner that led to war.</p>
<p class="indent">National animosity is even more dangerous when it becomes racial, as in the case of Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism. Underlying the whole structure of nationalism in Europe, there had been efforts to unite all Germans and all Slaves.</p>
<p class="indent">Germany was advocating the unity of all Germans in the Balkans, while the Russians were preaching Pan-Slavism. Russia backed Serbia in the Balkans, while Germany backed Austria for expansion in the same territory. Even literature became chauvinistic. Writers like H.S. Chamberlain glorified Teutonic supremacy. Rudyard Kipling eulogised British imperialism and the whiteman’s superiority.</p>
<p class="indent">Closely associated with nationalism, if not actually part of it, was economic imperialism or the rush for colonies. The race for colonies, which would serve as suppliers of raw materials and markets for finished goods, provided one of the most potent sources for international misunderstandings. Businessmen made use of politics to force governments to seek colonies, and territorial expansion was encouraged by patriotic organisations and newspapers. A mad rush for colonies came in the last quarter of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. England had a major part of the territory available for colonisation. France was a close second, with her African colonies and Far Eastern possessions. Russia had a vast expanse of territory, including a large part of both Europe and Asia.</p>
<p class="indent">Germany and Italy were left with no place in which they could satisfy their hunger for territory. The available land for colonisation had been occupied and was in the process of being acquired by other power. However, this fact did not despair the Germans. Germany tried to prevent France from acquiring Morocco. She sought possessions in the Far East and attempted to penetrate the Near East at the expense of England.</p>
<p class="indent">The main reason for England’s participation in the Triple Entente was to check Germany’s economic expansion. Both groups, the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente, aimed at economic expansion and furnished one of the primary causes off the conflict.</p>
<p class="indent">The most significant international development in the period preceding World War I was the formation of two great alliances: the ‘Triple Alliance’ and the ‘Triple Entente’. They resulted in the division of Europe into two rival camps and paved the way for the outbreak of the Great War. Bismarck masterminded the formation of the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria and Italy). After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870&ndash;71, he adopted a policy which aimed at keeping France isolated and preventing her from establishing friendly relations with any other European country. He himself, however, formed a Dual Alliance with Austria in 1879. Italy joined it in 1882, making it a Triple Alliance.</p>
<p class="indent">So long as Bismarck was at the helm of affairs, he did not allow any country to make friendship with France. When he was compelled to give up the Chancellorship, the men who were appointed to take his place did not have the slightest idea of the character or the purpose of the diplomatic structure that he had built. As a result, France got a chance to establish friendly relations with Russia and even formed an alliance with it, viz. the Dual Entente (France, Russia and England &ndash; 1907). The second step was the formation of the ‘Anglo-French Entente Cordiale’ in 1904, and finally came the Triple Entente in 1907 when all the three parties agreed to complete the diplomatic triangle. The Triple Entente was a response to the Triple Alliance. Later on, Japan joined the Triple Entente, while Turkey joined the Triple Alliance.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-458" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Colonial Empires in 1914</p>
<p class="indent">At the very outset, the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente were antagonistic to each other. Consequently, even trivial issues produced crises. Each controversy tended to draw the nations one step nearer to the crisis point, and between 1904 and 1914, there was an abundance of such controversies. The first in the series was the Moroccan controversy of 1905, which arose from an effort of Germany to arrest French expansion in Africa. France had the support of her allies, Russia and England. So, Germany was compelled to retreat. In this crisis, the Triple Entente held together, but Germany did not receive any support from either of her allies, viz. Austria and Italy. The second was the result of the annexation of Bosnia by Austria in 1908. Austria and Russia had a secret agreement to the effect that Russia was to help Austria obtain Bosnia, while Austria was to help Russia in acquiring Constantinople. Russian failure to get Constantinople (because of the opposition of England) led her to protest against Austrian action. The alliances held together&mdash;Austria was supported by Germany, while France was backed by Russia&mdash;but not to the extent of military aid. The third problem was that of Agadir (1911), in which Morocco was again <a id="calibre_link-459" class="calibre10"></a>the issue. Germany made a final effort to keep France out, but failed. The fourth crisis was the outbreak of the Balkan Wars in 1912. The Balkan states made a successful attempt to free themselves from the control of Turkey, after which they quarrelled among themselves over the division of the spoils and lost most of what they had gained. The international consequence of the wars rested on the interests that the powers had in the outcome. Austria, supported by Germany, was expanding into the Balkans. The Germans were building a railroad, planned to reach from Berlin to Baghdad, that would enable them to tap the natural resources of Mesopotamia and obtain some of the trade with the Far East.</p>
<p class="indent">Consequently, they were interested in protecting Turkey and in suppressing the Balkan states. England opposed German and Austrian expansion, because it was a threat to her interests in the Near East. France supported Russia, and opposed Turkey. This controversy, popularly known as the ‘Near Eastern Question’, was still unsettled when a Serbian nationalist assassinated the Austrian archduke in Bosnia.</p>
<p class="indent">Peace always remained an ideal among European statesmen, but no significant progress was made for realising it. At the Congress of Vienna, the Concert of Europe was proposed to prevent the outbreak of future wars. The Declaration of Paris in 1856 drew up rules to protect neutral trade in times of war. The Hague Conference, called by the Czar of Russia in 1899, was attended by representatives of 26 states. A second Hague Conference (1907) tried to humanise war by the elimination of practices of barbarism. Subsequent history shows how miserably all these attempts failed.</p>
<p class="indent">The causes for the failure of international pacifism are not far to seek. Intense nationalism made arbitrations difficult, regardless of how trivial was the dispute. Patriots talked about honor, love of country, etc., and neglected the consideration of the question from a judicial point of view. Territorial disputes hampered the prospects for peace. A number of regions such as Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, and the Dardenelles, were sore spots, which refused to heal. Military men and munition-makers, such as the Krupps in Germany, the Vickars in England, and the Scheiders in France, made it a business not only to sell munitions but also to promote war in order to facilitate their trade. These conditions made arbitration and conciliation hard to succeed.</p>
<p class="indent">A good index of public opinion and an indication of the general uneasiness in 1914 can be seen in the extent of preparedness on the part of the various states. France and Russia had 22.39 lakh armed men in 1914. The Central Powers, excluding Italy, had 12.39 lakh men ready for service. In addition, France and Russia had 50.7 lakh trained reserves, while Germany and Austria (Central Powers) had 33.58 lakhs. The expenditures for military purposes between 1910 and 1914 reached stupendous figures. France and Russia spent $ 2,320 million, while Germany and Austria made on outlay of $ 1,886 million. A nation armed to the teeth is not likely to be willing to make concessions to an enemy.</p>
<p class="indent">The predominant position held by the military class in several countries, such as Germany and Russia, did not lend a conciliatory attitude. Their profession was war; honours and promotions come to military men in times of war, not in times of peace.</p>
<p class="indent">The anxiety and suspicion between the already antagonistic groups were increased by secret diplomacy. Most of the existing treaties in 1914 were not on their own aggressive or dangerous, but the fact that their provisions were secret, led opponents to use their fertile imagination as to what they might include. Fear over what the alliance between Germany and Austria might mean prompted France to form an alliance with Russia. Germany was blamed <a id="calibre_link-460" class="calibre10"></a>for a supposed understanding with Austria to conquer the world and, especially to destroy France. When the treaty finally became public, long after the war was over, it was found to be essentially defensive rather than offensive.</p>
<p class="indent">The assassination of the Austrian Archduke, Ferdinand, by a Serbian nationalist on 28<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> June 1914 in Bosnia sparked off World War I. At first thought, it looked unbelievable that the death of one man in a remote Balkan town could drag the whole world into life-and-death struggle. The event was the occasion, not the real cause, for the war. Tension had developed to such an extent that only a slight impact was needed to break the slender threads that held opposing factions apart. The time was ripe for the states to capitalise on an accident, to measure swords with opponents whom, they felt, must destroy sooner or later.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did the War take Place?</b></i></span> The war began with the German army crossing Belgium on the way to France. After a few months, Italy left the Central Powers (Germany and Austria) and joined the Allies with the hope of acquiring territories from Austria. Japan also declared war against Germany with the hope of obtaining the German colonies in the East; Turkey, afraid of Russia, joined the Central Powers. In 1916 Rumania and in the next year, China were forced into war against Germany. Even the far away United States was drawn into the conflict in 1917, in spite of the Monroe Doctrine and the time-tested policy of isolation. Most of the Americans initially felt that the war was strictly a European conflict, but economic complexities gradually drew them too into the struggle.</p>
<p class="indent">In no time, it was evident that the advance of modern technical science had drastically transformed the nature of warfare. Motivated by the feelings of hate and suspicion, the governments of Europe found themselves with unprecedented powers of destruction and defiance in their hands. The war became a consuming fire round and about the world, adversely affecting both victors and vanquished very disproportionately to the issues involved. The initial stage of the war witnessed tremendous rush of the Germans upon Paris and an invasion of East Prussia by the Russians. Both attacks were stopped and retaliated. Then the power of resistance grew; there was a rapid development of trench warfare until for a time, the opposing armies lay entrenched in long lines across Europe, unable to make any advance without huge losses.</p>
<p class="indent">This phase of military deadlock slowly changed into one of aggression upon the enemy population behind the fronts by the destruction of food supplies and by attacks through the air. Further, there was a gradual advance in the size and range of guns employed and of such ingenious devices as poison gas shells and impenetrable tanks to breakdown the resistance of troops in the trenches. The air offensive was the most important of all the new methods. It carried warfare from two dimensions into three.</p>
<p class="indent">Hitherto in human history war was fought only where the armies marched and met. Now it spread everywhere. The air offensive took war over and past the front to an ever-increasing area of civilian activities beyond. The traditional division between the civilian and combatant population disappeared. Everyone and everything became a fair game for destruction. The air offensive kept rising in range and terror with every month in the war. At last most parts of Europe were in a state of siege and subject to nightly raids. Cities like London and Paris went through sleepless nights. While the bombs burst, the anti-aircraft guns maintained an unbearable racket, and the fire engines and ambulances rushed headlong through the darkened and deserted streets.</p>
<p class="indent">Fighting was formally over in November 1908 when peace was arrived at by both the parties. After a magnificent effort in the spring of 1918 that almost took the Germans to Paris, the Central Powers broke down. Both their spirit and resources were exhausted. Though the Allies had won on the battlefield, an equally bitter struggle had to be fought at the conference table, and years of economic and social readjustment had to take place before the massive impact of the war could be overcome.</p>

<p class="caption">Events leading to world war I</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Economic Impact?</b></i></span> All the production activity, except that which helped war efforts, had come to a standstill during the war. For, all the able bodied men of Europe were recruited in the armies and navies or in the impoverished factories that supplied them. The industry of the world was crippled, and inflation caused financial ruin of several people. Moreover, by 1918, major part of Europe was in a state of severe famine. The production of food throughout the world had decreased rapidly because of the recruitment of peasantry in the armed forces, and the distribution of whatever food produced was hampered by the destruction caused by submarine, by the breach of customary routes through the closing of frontiers, and by the dislocation of the transport system of the world. Governments took control of the falling food supplies and rationed their populations. So, by the fourth year of the war, the whole world was suffering from shortage of clothing and housing as well as food. Business and economic life was in total chaos.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-462" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00058.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Course of World War I</p>
<p class="indent">The importance of the economic impact of the war became clear from its destruction of property. The total cost of the war amounted to $ 186 billion. The average daily cost was $ 126 million, or $ 5.25 million an hour, from the declaration of war to the conclusion of the peace. Some of the powers, in fact, had hoped to acquire economic supremacy through the war, but economic chaos came instead, even to the victorious. Russia and Italy from the victorious side and Germany and Austria from the defeated side, for example, were all economically ruined.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of the material damage done in Europe during the war, however, proved comparatively easy to repair. By 1922, the production of materials like coal, iron and steel, the output of manufactures, and rail-road mileage were all higher than in 1912. Despite tariff barriers put up by the new states, intra-European commerce had managed an almost complete recovery. Many changes had, of course, taken place. Industries were changing to mass production and wherever possible machines were replacing human labour. Partly due to this, but more importantly due to political changes, the work day was getting shortened. The eight-hour day that had previously seemed to be only an ideal now became a reality.</p>
<p class="indent">None of these &ndash; neither mass production nor changes in working conditions nor even changes in consumer interests, like the new rage <a id="calibre_link-463" class="calibre10"></a>in Western Europe and the USA for new houses and new automobiles &mdash; can be attributed to the war. With regard to the economic changes related to the conflict, they emanate from the field of finance. For, the war had one clear outcome: it made North America rather than Europe the centre of wealth.</p>
<p class="indent">The war left the European victors indebted to the USA to the tune of $ 10 billion. Moreover, when the exchanges were relaxed in 1919, the British pound lost by one-fifth in value as compared with the dollar, while the franc fell by 50%. The French attempt to extort reparation payments from Germany in particular was partly due to a desire to recover lost ground. The Germans despite pressure, were unable to pay. Inflation resulted in the German mark becoming worthless; it stood at 4.6 million to the dollar in August 1923, and at 4.2 trillion to the dollar in November. An international committee under the leadership of an American, Charles G. Dawes, proposed that a new financial system be adopted by the Germans and that reparations demanded by the Allies be cut down. This Dawes’ plan was adopted in 1924. The inflation emptied savings, put great hardships on the German middle classes, and paved the ground for Adolf Hitler’s capture of power in 1933. To a limited extent, financial disturbances created hardships for the middle classes all over Europe, and thus strengthened the tendency toward democratic government.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Social Impact?</b></i></span> If the war’s economic impact was lesser than that expected by contemporaries, its social impact was great and was different from what most people of the time predicted. During the war, there was a large scale replacement of men by women in industry. More than half the people in the combatant countries of Europe changed their employment altogether during the war. They were socially uprooted and transplanted. Education and normal scientific work was limited or diverted to immediate military ends, and the distribution of news was impeded and corrupted by military control and propaganda activities. The effects of the cruelties of the war upon the minds and health of old people and young children were specially painful and destructive. Finally, pestilence, that old follower of warfare, did not arrive until the very end of the fighting in 1918. For four years people were free from any form of general epidemic; then came a great outbreak of influenza which consumed millions of people.</p>
<p class="indent">During the war, politicians and publicists spoke of the happy days to come, when there would be no wars, no armaments, no clashes between nations, and no more want. The actuality of the harsh compromise in the treaties, together with continued violence in Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia, mutual distrust among the victors and sharp recession following the immediate post-war boom, all resulted in a widespread sense of disappointment. Some felt that they had been sufficiently Utopian, others felt that they had been impractical.</p>
<p class="indent">Still others concluded that the outcome of the war had proved all governments incapable of catering to the interests of common men or had proved man’s destiny to be something altogether beyond man’s control. From these various moods took birth an increasingly strong pacifist movement; violent and annihilist movements like that of the Nazis in Germany; escapism that gave great popularity to esoteric poets, novelists and painters; and a brooding fatalism had found reflection in such writings as those of Oswald Spengler and Soren Kierkegard.</p>
<p class="indent">The war had been modern civilisation’s most ugly experience. In some parts of Western Europe, it had taken the life of one young man out of four and in generations that matured in the 1920s and 1930s few could understand for what purpose it had been fought. The statistics of the toll of the war in the life is as follows: <a id="calibre_link-464" class="calibre10"></a>About 8 million individuals were killed in action or died of wounds received in battle. Above 19 million were wounded of whom more than a third were totally impaired. The total casualties were over 27 million and to this number should be added a great many who have died from causes to be traced directly or back to the war. The experience created trauma in the consciousness of most of the peoples who had taken part in it and this fact is of utmost importance for the understanding of the events that took place for many years to follow.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Peace Settlements?</b></i></span> Separate peace treaties were signed, with each of the vanquished Central Powers: the Versailles Treaty with Germany, June 28,1919: the St. Germain Treaty with Austria, September 10, 1919; the Trianon Treaty with Hungary, March 22, 1919; the Neuilly Treaty with Bulgaria, November 27, 1919; and the Sevres Treaty with Turkey, August 20, 1920. Three features of this overall peace settlement are significant for world history: the establishment of the League of Nations, the application of the principle of self-determination in Europe, and the failure to apply this principle outside Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">The League of Nations was organised in order to attain two main goals. The first was to preserve the peace. Its members were to give each other mutual protection against aggression, to submit disputes to arbitration or inquiry, and to abstain from war until three <a id="calibre_link-465" class="calibre10"></a>months after arbitration. The second was to concern itself with health, social, economic, and humanitarian problems of international scope. For this purpose, there were established specialised League bodies such as the Health Organisation, the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, and the International Labour Organisation, as well as numerous temporary advisory commissions. By and large, the League succeeded brilliantly in its second goal. It proved invaluable in improving international labour conditions, promoting world health, combating the narcotic and slave traffics, and coping with economic crises. The League was not able to keep the peace, and since this was its chief aim, that failure spelled the end of the entire organisation.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00085.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Casualties in world war I</p>
<p class="indent">The peace settlement was characterised by the redrawing of European frontiers on the basis of the principle of self-determination. This, stated explicitly in the 14 points, was officially implemented in the various peace treaties. The net result was a drastic revision of the map of Europe. Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France without question. Russia was deprived of most of its Baltic coastline by the establishment of the independent states of Finland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.</p>
<p class="indent">An independent Poland was created, carved out of former Russian, German, and Hapsburg provinces; Czechoslovakia emerged from the former Hapsburg Empire. Yugoslavia also appeared, comprising pre-war Serbia and Monte Negro and various former Hapsburg territories inhabited by the Slavs. Rumania more than doubled in size as a result of its acquisitions from Austria&ndash;Hungary, Russia, and Bulgaria. Finally, from the remains of the old Hapsburg Empire, there emerged the two states of Austria and Hungary.</p>
<p class="indent">The principle of self-determination was not respected in every instance in the drawing of the new frontiers. Indeed, there were bitter protests concerning the sizeable German minorities in Poland and Czechoslovakia, and the Russian minorities in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Rumania. The explanation for this friction is to be found partly in the fact that the numerous ethnic groups in Central and Eastern Europe were so inextricably mixed that no frontiers could be drawn without creating considerable minorities on one side or the other. The inevitable minorities, however, were substantially increased because frontiers sometimes were drawn to satisfy strategic considerations as well as nationalist aspirations. This was why the Sudeten Germans were left in Czechoslovakia, why the Tyrol Germans were left in Italy, and why the union of Austria and Germany was specifically forbidden by the St. Germain Treaty even though it would have been in accord with popular will, at least in the immediate post-war years. Yet despite these deviations, the new frontiers were infinitely more in accord with nationalist aspirations than the old. The number of minority people was much smaller after World War I than before.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the peacemakers generally applied self-determination in Europe, they definitely did not do so outside Europe. This discrimination was clearly evident in Wilson’s 14 points, which specially spelled out how the aspirations of the various European minorities were to be satisfied. By contrast, point 5 declared that in the colonies ‘the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined.’ The significant point here is the reference to the interests rather than to the ‘wishes’ of the colonial peoples. Needless to say, it was the Europeans themselves who decided what these ‘interests’ were, and the outcome was a modified form of imperial rule known as the Mandate System.</p>
<p class="indent">Article 22 of the League Covenant referred to the inhabitants of the colonies taken from the Central Powers as ‘people not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world’. The article accordingly provided that the ‘tutelage of <a id="calibre_link-466" class="calibre10"></a>such people should be entrusted to advanced nations who, by reason of their resources, their experience, or their geographical position, can best undertake this responsibility... and that this tutelage should be exercised by them as Mandatories on behalf off the League’. It is significant that this provision for ‘tutelage’ under ‘Mandatories’ was not extended to the colonies of the victorious Allies, whose inhabitants in many cases were at a similar level of development or lack of development.</p>
<p class="indent">The Mandates article divided the foreign and overseas territories of Germany and the Ottoman Empire into A, B and C mandates. The category varies according to the level of development of the territory concerned. On this basis, the former Ottoman possessions were put in Class A and the German colonies in B and C. Of the Ottoman territories, Mesopotamia and Palestine were allotted to Britain as the Mandatory Power, and Syria and Lebanon to France. Of the German colonies, the greater part of Tanganyika went to Britain and the remainder to Belgium; Togoland and the Camerons were divided between Britain and France; Southwest Africa was allotted to the Union of South Africa; and Germany’s Pacific islands north of the equator went to Japan, and those south of the equator to Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p class="indent">The Mandatory Powers assumed specific obligations toward the inhabitants of the mandate territories. For fulfillment of these obligations, they were accountable to the permanent Mandates Commission and were required to report annually to the Council of the League of Nations. Though neither the Commission nor the League itself had authority to force a recalcitrant mandatory power to fulfill its obligation, it is significant that European <a id="calibre_link-467" class="calibre10"></a>states for the first time accepted certain specified procedures. The procedures varied according to the type of mandate. In the case of Class A, the Mandates article looked forward specifically to the granting of independence as soon as feasible. The duty of the mandatory power was merely ‘the rendering of administrative advice and assistance until such time as they (the people of the mandated territory) are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the mandatory power’. For Class B and C Mandates, there was no reference to eventual independence. The obligation, rather, was to provide administration in accordance with the interests of the inhabitants.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00112.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Europe after peace of Paris 1919</p>
<p class="indent">Although the Mandate System represented certain improvements over the traditional division of colonial booty by the victors in a war, nevertheless, it is strongly reminiscent of the 1815 Settlement because it ignored national aspirations. The inhabitants of the Ottoman territories did not want mandate status and were violently opposed to France as mandatory power. Their wishes were directly flouted when Syria and Lebanon were allotted to France. Even in the case of some of the Class B Mandates in Africa, there was acute dissatisfaction with the arrangements made. It is not surprising, then, that just as the ignoring of nationalist wishes in 1815 led to a long series of revolutions in Europe during the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, so this Mandate System was to lead to uprisings in the colonial world during the post-war years.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the War’s Significance?</b></i></span> A cursory glance at the world map before and after World War reveals comparatively new changes. Europe’s frontiers were different because of the disappearance of four empires, but so far as the world as a whole was concerned, European dominance appeared undiminished. Britain, France, and the other imperial powers still ruled as many overseas colonies as before 1914. Indeed, their possessions were even greater, for they now controlled territories in the Middle East that formerly had been under the Ottoman Sultan. Thus, Europe’s global hegemony appeared to be more complete after World War I than before.</p>
<p class="indent">Beneath the surface, however, the situation was entirely different. The overriding significance of World War I from a global viewpoint is precisely that it began the undermining of Europe’s supremacy &ndash; a process that was completed after World War II. The undermining was evident in at least three regards; economic decline, the crises, and the weakening hold over the colonies.</p>
<p class="indent">Before 1914, Europe’s economy was dependent to a considerable degree upon massive overseas investments yielding massive annual returns. During World War I, however, Britain lost a quarter of its foreign investments, France a third, and Germany lost all. The reverse of this trend may be seen in the new financial strength of the United States. In 1914, the United States owed about $ 4 billion to European investors, but by 1919 the United States had become a creditor nation to the tune of $3.7 billion; by 1930 this had risen to $ 8.8 billion. The same pattern is evident in industry, for many European industrial areas were devastated, while American factories mushroomed spectacularly under the impetus of unlimited wartime demand. By 1929, the United States was responsible for no less than 42.2 percent of the world industrial output, an amount greater than that of all the countries of Europe, including Russia. Thus, the economic relationships between Europe and the United States were reversed as a result of World War I. Europe no longer was the banker and the workshop of the world, as it had been during the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Leadership in both areas had crossed the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="indent">The war gutted Europe politically as well as economically. Prior to 1914 Europe had been the source of the basic political ideas and <a id="calibre_link-468" class="calibre10"></a>institutions of modern times. Their impact, as we have seen, had been felt in all corners of the globe. The holocaust of war, however, left Europeans demoralised and unbelieving. In all parts of the Continent, the old order was being questioned and challenged. In this revolutionary crisis many Europeans looked for guidance to two non-Europeans, the American Wilson and the Russian Lenin. Wilson’s 14 points had stirred up a ferment of democratic hope and expectancy. When he stepped on the blood-soaked soil of Europe in December 1918, huge crowds greeted Wilson with delirious enthusiasm as ‘King of Humanity’, ‘Saviour’, ‘Prince of Peace’. They listened avidly to his plans for a future of peace and security. At the same time, another gospel of salvation was coming from the East. Millions of dead and wounded, the smoking ruins of cities and villages made large masses receptive to the call for revolution and for a new social order. In imitation of the Bolshevik revolution, Soviets were set up in Berlin, Hamburg, and Budapest. Demonstrations were staged in the streets of London, Paris, and Rome.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, Europe’s domination was undermined by World War I because of the repercussions in the overseas colonies. The spectacle of one bloc of European powers fighting another to the bitter end damaged the prestige of the white master irreparably. No longer was he regarded as almost divinely ordained to rule over coloured subjects. Equally disruptive was the participation in the war of millions of colonials as soldiers or as labourers. Indian divisions fought on the western front and in Mesopotamia; many Africans in French uniform fought in Northern France; and large numbers of Chinese and Indo-Chinese served in labour battalions behind the lines. Needless to say, the colonials who returned home after such experiences were not likely to be as obedient to European overlords as before.</p>
<p class="indent">Revolutionary ideas in the colonies were also spread by propaganda associated with the conduct of the war. It is true that Wilson’s 14 points had referred only to the ‘interest’ rather than to the desires of the colonial peoples. This was an over-fine distinction in a time of war. The revolutionary phrase ‘self-determination of people’ left its imprint on the colonial world as well as upon Europe. Equally influential were the ideologies of socialism and communism. Before World War I, Asian intellectuals had been inspired by western Liberalism and Nationalism. They had quoted Voltaire, Mazzini, and John Stuart Mill, but their sons now were likely to quote Marx, Lenin, or Harold Laski.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-60"><b class="calibre9">WORLD DEPRESSION OF 1929&ndash;1932</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Nutshell Account</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In economics, ‘depression’ means a sudden decline or slump in trade, industry, agriculture and general prosperity. Though there had been several depressions in the history of the modern world, the World Depression of 1929&ndash;1932 was unprecedented both in its intensity and impact. This World Depression witnessed a world slump in agriculture, finance and industry. The slump in agriculture was caused by over production in certain regions and maldistribution. Agricultural slump in the US was aggravated by the slump in finance which was in turn caused by a fever of speculation leading first to withdrawal of funds from Europe and later to the panic known as the ‘Wall Street Crash’ of October 1929, and in Europe, by the collapse of the Austrian Credit-Anstalt, a bank with interests throughout the Danubian lands, precipitated by French withdrawal of short-term credit. The slump in industry was caused by a fall in exports and internal consumption resulting from shortage of capital, leading to reduced industrial production, less need of transport (hitting the shipping industry) and producing mass unemployment. The general impact of the Depression was to lead to increased economic planning (e.g., New Deal of Roosevelt), intensified economic nationalism (e.g., erection of high tariff walls), and the encouragement of political nationalist movements as an alternative to communism (e.g., Nazism in Germany).</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-469" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00139.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">New European states after World War I</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the World Depression?</b></i></span> The ‘Great Depression’, which put an end to all hopes of a continued period of peace and prosperity, began in October 1929 in the Wall Street (the financial headquarters of New York). It was unsensational in its beginning; it seemed at first to be no more than a rather large-scale hasty selling of securities which the wiser operators knew already were overpriced. But the selling did not stop; as each day passed more and more stocks and shares were thrown into the market, and prices slumped.</p>
<p class="indent">Soon the shares of even the best companies were worth barely quarter of what they once were, and for others there was a complete dearth of buyers. The rich men of America, the bankers and captains of industry, who had no comprehension of what was happening, more than once, united to purchase securities ‘to support the market’; it was like building a fence to stop a flood. There was a momentary hesitation, and then the torrent poured on. The apparent stabilisation of capitalism after World War I was, therefore, short lived, for the world <a id="calibre_link-470" class="calibre10"></a>economy plunged into the worst depression in its history.</p>
<p class="indent">Though heralded by the Wall Street crash, it was some years before it became apparent that this Depression was no ordinary cyclical downturn. It affected every capitalist country, and its depth and length defied all explanation. Even on the eve of World War II, the Depression had not been completely overcome.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the Depression was concentrated in the USA, it was the special and intimate relationships established between the US and other capitalist economies after World War I that accounted for its rapid diffusion and harsh impact. It is also clear that the stabilisation that had taken place in the other countries and the boom conditions of many in the late 1920s concealed serious shortcomings. The British economy’s inability to resume capital exports, the decline of its basic industries, the consequences of the over valuation of sterling all weakened the world economy and thrust greater responsibilities upon the USA. The investment boom in European countries following reconstruction could only continue so long as markets could be found; a cyclical downturn was inevitable sooner or later. The problems of the primary producers (now weak sellers as a result of over production) reduced the market for manufactured goods and slowed their growth rate.</p>
<p class="indent">In return to gold, some currencies had been overvalued, others undervalued, and the Depression struck before adjustments could be made. Moreover, international financial relations were no longer on pre-war lines. War debts and reparations weakened capitalist countries, leaving the USA as the major creditor. The 1920s boom in Europe had been financed by an outflow of US funds, much of the investment being on a short-term basis and already being withdrawn in the last phase of Wall Street speculation before the crash. Any investigation of the causes of the Depression must consider the changed role of the USA as the new main support of prosperity in the capitalist world. Once the US economy had slumped, there was no prospect of maintaining prosperity elsewhere.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Occur?</b></i></span> In contrast to the general impression, the Depression was not caused or even started by a stock market crash in October 1929. The roots of the Depression lay in a fundamental imbalance in the economic structure, aggravated by the peace settlement following World War I. Seeming prosperity in the USA during the 1920s concealed the dangers but agriculture and other important sections were depressed, as was much of Europe’s economy. What the Wall Street Crash did was to expose all these weaknesses of the US as well as other capitalist economies.</p>
<p class="indent">The US economy had experienced occasional periods of depressed business activity even in the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, and fairly regular business cycles with international links began to appear in the 1850s. But until the 1930s bad times had not often lasted more than a year.</p>
<p class="indent">The US prosperity in the 1920s had some weak spots. Each year throughout the decade, on the average, 600 banks failed, along with nearly 20,000 other business concerns. Most of the time unemployment had averaged 2.2 million, almost 5% of the work force. Mining, farming, and the textile industry had been depressed, and in 1928 the construction boom had ended.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides, in 1929, Europe as a whole had not fully regained the economic levels it had attained before World War I. Prices and incomes throughout the world were depressed because underdeveloped nations, aided by US loans, had over expanded their raw material production capacity. The 1919 Peace of Paris was not economically sound. Punitive reparations, loss of colonies, and changes in national boundaries made German and mid-European recuperation nearly impossible and contributed to a spirit of revenge that nourished Hitlerism.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-471" class="calibre10"></a>Britain purposely deflated domestic incomes in a misguided effort to make up for wartime capital consumption in export industries and to maintain the gold standard. French devaluation made Paris a haven for American artists and writers but not for French workers, whose real wages fell. Until 1931, the USA insisted shortsightedly on repayment of war debts although the effect could only be a drain of needed resources out of war-damaged economies. American private capital flowed to the rest of the world, where it was used partly to settle war claims, partly to enlarge already overproduction in industries, and partly to prop up dictatorships. This capital export helped conceal the basic weakness of the world market system.</p>
<p class="indent">American economist, John K. Galbraith, in his book, ‘The Great Crash, 1929,’ ascribed the Depression to five main causes, (1) Unequal income distribution, which limited the consumer goods market and made investment and luxury spending erratic (bad news from Wall Street sent both down), (2) Fraudulent business, which abounded in a kind of flood tide of corporate theft (3) Banking structure, which contained too many independent units, causing bankers to yield to over optimism or to act foolishly, and once one bank failed, the whole system collapsed, (4) The new creditor position of the USA which besides resulting in unwise foreign lending, was coupled with tariffs so that foreign countries could not service their debts by increasing exports USA, resulting in default and the inability of foreigners to continue to pay for US exports, and (5) The poor state of economic intelligence.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Economic Impact?</b></i></span> As mentioned earlier, there had been depressions before, but this was unheard of in its violence. Its effects were maximised not only by the disastrous ‘foreign debts’ and tariffs policy, but by particular results of uncontrolled private ownership and enterprise. Moreover, the unbalanced nature of US economy made recovery difficult. The needs of the rich had been catered for, and the less fortunate ignored. Now, it was difficult to destroy the demand for bread, beef, simple clothing and other needs of poor men; but it was easy to wipe out, overnight, the demand for expensive motor cars, new mansions, and luxury goods generally and to stop investment by the rich in everything. Soon factories, mills and shipyards were closing down, un-saleable expensive cars piled up and their owners sold apples in the streets; farmers went bankrupt, and their lands went wild. At the beginning of 1933, nearly 20 million people were said to be facing starvation.</p>
<p class="indent">In the modern world, this kind of disaster could not be confined to one country; it spread wider than any plague since the Black Death. American investment in Germany ceased in 1929. Next year, American loans were called in. The wicked and absurd system based on ‘reparations’ now had its natural results. The Credit-Anstalt, the bank that financed most of Austrian industry, faced bankruptcy; German banks and the Bank of England came to its rescue, but the strain was merely passed on to them. The Bank of England was now in danger, and there was not enough gold to meet its obligations. Now gold could only be found in the vaults of Paris and New York banks; Paris would lend none and New York insisted upon changes in British internal policy (notably, cutting down unemployment relief, which, of course, would cut down demand equally); the weak British Labour government resisted and was thrown out of power; its conservative successor agreed to fullfil the condition which was no good; the pound broke, and lost a fifth of its value; the gold standard was abandoned. London had been the financial centre of the world, and international trade was now in chaos. The only country unaffected by this Depression of 1929&ndash;32 was the USSR, because it did not maintain any significant trade and commercial links with the western world.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-472" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Social Impact?</b></i></span> The above economic catastrophes gave rise to problems of corresponding magnitude. Most serious was the mass unemployment which reached tragic proportions. In March 1933, the number of people out of work in the US was estimated conservatively at over 14 million or a fourth of the total labour force. In Britain, the jobless were numbered at nearly 3 million, representing about the same proportion of workers as in the US. Germany was, in fact, the worst off with more than 2/5ths of trade unionists wholly unemployed, and another one-fifth on part-time work.</p>
<p class="indent">Unemployment of this scale drastically lowered living standards in all countries. Even in the wealthy US, there was wholesale misery and privation, especially in the beginning, when relief was left to private and local agencies with inadequate funds. In Britain, where unemployment had been chronic through the 1920s, the situation now became worse. A substantial proportion of a whole generation was growing up with little opportunity or prospect of finding employment. Some bitterly referred to their purposeless existence as a ‘living death’. In Germany, with its higher percentage of jobless people, the frustrations and tensions were more acute. Eventually, they made it possible for Hitler to triumph, for social dislocation on such a large scale inevitably had profound political repercussions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Political Impact?</b></i></span> The political consequences of this world disaster were, to some extent, a mere hazard. Wherever the people of a country were able to exercise a choice, the dominant government was thrown out. If it was progressive, reaction took control; if it was conservative, radicals came to power. In the USA, the Republicans had so far taken credit for the boom, but now they were hurled from power in 1932 by the Democrats led by Franklin D. Roosevelt. In Spain, the king quietly left Madrid and handed over power to a Republic. Usually it was the other way round. The British conservatives were able to fasten the blame on to their Labour predecessors, and held power, with some liberal allies, until well into the next year. The Japanese militarists, not contended with removing their more pacific predecessors from office, killed those they disliked one by one in the succeeding years. Dictators took over from feeble parliaments in country after country in Eastern and Central Europe and in South America; the worst disaster of all was the collapse of the German Republic and its capture by the Nazis led by Adolf Hitler. This succession of disasters to freedom and equality in the separate countries was bound to lead to similar disasters internationally. There was but one major power, the USA, where progressive ideas had any power. But, unfortunately, it was hypnotised by the delusion that to keep clear off all foreign problems was the way to safety. Moreover, though few people knew it, the League of Nations was already doomed because its constituent members now had neither the will nor the power to keep it alive; it would not be long before the dictators realised that there was nothing to stop them resorting to violence internationally as well as internally to gain their ends.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Governmental Response?</b></i></span> It was generally assumed by economists, at least well into the 1930s, that government intervention should be minimal, the assumption being that government intervention could not coerce, and might aggravate, a market disequilibrium. Indeed, some felt the depression was partly a consequence of governmental intervention. Whenever a government began to intervene, the orthodox majority continued to blame it for the economy’s failure to recover quickly and completely. Since the 1930’s, however, economic opinion has moved to the view that governments should have intervened with appropriate weapons to remedy what was seen as the <a id="calibre_link-473" class="calibre10"></a>basic cause of depression, viz. a deficiency in demand.</p>
<p class="indent">The World Depression had such severe consequences, both economic and non-economic, that even reluctant governments could not stand aside. The price of non-intervention was ‘Social Revolution’, and intervention was, or could be, a weapon of counter-revolution, as under the Nazi regime in Germany. Intervention, therefore, took place pragmatically, and its forms were at first ‘orthodox’ in that they consisted of old, well-tried methods.</p>
<p class="indent">First, the tendency toward Economic Nationalism was reinforced as governments imposed tariffs or raised existing ones and added quotas and other devices to protect home producers. As the depression continued, protection tended to be used aggressively to bargain with other countries and penetrate foreign markets. The disintegration of multilateralism, which was often replaced by bilateral trading agreements, accompanied the decline of world trade. The immediate effect of all these measures was to reduce the volume of international trade and create conditions of trade war.</p>
<p class="indent">Along with this went the breakdown of the gold standard. With their objective base for parity destroyed, currencies became subject to government action, and some form of exchange control had to be established if balance of payments, difficulties were not to be exaggerated by speculative currency movements. Countries, like France, which delayed establishing exchange controls did so to their cost. Nazi Germany, on the other hand, by means of rigid controls, could operate parallel exchange rates to its advantage and at the expense of weaker trading partners.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did the Recovery Take Place?</b></i></span> The World Depression of 1929&ndash;32 shook Capitalism to its foundations, and was the major formative influence on political and social as well as economic life. Despite millions of people being unemployed throughout the decade and the triumph of Nazism in Germany and the subsequent drive to war, most years of the 1930s were, however, years of recovery, though recovery from a low level. The depression itself had prepared the ground for recovery through the normal cyclical process.</p>
<p class="indent">Recovery came slowly and in many countries was far from complete by World War II. Until there was a revival of world trade, the primary producers could not raise their incomes. On the other hand, in the advanced countries, even those as export dependent as Britain and Germany, it was possible to find a substitute for exports. In Germany, this was chiefly war production. In Britain, although rearmament in the late 1930s helped recovery, it had earlier depended upon expansion of the home market, the shift to new industries, and the continuous rise in service activities, even in the ‘depressed areas’.</p>
<p class="indent">As a major importer of food stuffs and raw materials, Britain was able to take advantage of the deterioration in terms of trade of primary products. This enabled consumers to spend more of their income on food items and expanded the consumer goods and services market, creating new opportunities for profitable investment and employment. It assisted manufacturers directly and consumers indirectly through the relative cheapening of imported raw materials. Almost all persons could, thus, improve their real income, at the expense, in part, of primary producers abroad. Where those primary producers were to a large extent at home, as in France, these conditions for recovery did not exist.</p>
<p class="indent">All governments realised that something had to be done to relieve what amounted to a national catastrophe. The Soviet Union’s example had begun to turn thoughts towards planning, even of capitalism, as a possibility. In the early years of the depression, the instinctive reaction of politicians was still strongly <a id="calibre_link-474" class="calibre10"></a>orthodox. The watchword virtually everywhere was to keep the budget balanced and avoid interference with free market forces. Policy was, thus, generally deflationary: Government expenditures were vigorously reduced, and the more consistently were such remedies applied, as in France, the more they aggravated the disease. In some cases, however, governments did not inadvertently run budget deficits through emergency action, and where they did so they began, possibly unwittingly, to assist recovery.</p>
<p class="indent">The real innovation, however, came when what was done in some cases by accident was pursued systematically. Here two experiments are worth mentioning. Both had the character of models (to be emulated or to be avoided) and both have preoccupied economists and historians since. One is the National Socialist Policy adopted in Germany by Adolf Hitler in 1933, which prepared the most powerful industrial nation in Europe for a new war. The other is the New Deal, which Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed to the American people after his inauguration at almost the same time. These two experiments can also be considered as alternative ways of saving Capitalism. Both shed light on the nature and efficacy of remedies for unemployment and depression that, during and after World War II, were to acquire immense prestige both among professional economists and the general public.</p>
<p class="indent">It was no secret that German recovery was based on a war economy. All participants in World War II experienced a similar process; but the German experience was novel. The Nazis established a full employment economy but one geared to war and with war as its inevitable outcome. Nor did the Nazi leaders try to disguise their intentions, which they rationalised as a need to acquire for Germany more ‘living space’. The Nazis did not establish a new economic system; they simply imposed greater state control on an economy that still rested upon private ownership and profit. Industrially, however, it was a highly concentrated economy, and it was big business that benefitted most directly from Hitler’s policies.</p>
<p class="indent">The New Deal, on the other hand, enabled President Roosevelt to overcome the dire emergency that confronted him on his inauguration without disaster and without making inroads into private property rights or political freedom. It did not, however, fully succeed in bringing about recovery. In fact, it took the colossal expenditures of World War II finally to overcome the Great Depression. In this respect, the New Deal can be contrasted with Nazi policy which found the complete answer to the Depression: arms expenditure limited only by physical resources. This was the answer, too, that American Capitalism found after 1940.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-61"><b class="calibre9">NEW DEAL OF FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Nutshell Account</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The social and economic reforms of Franklin D. Roosevelt between 1933 and 1940 were known as the ‘New Deal’. Roosevelt, after becoming the President of USA in 1933, declared a programme based on relief, recovery and reform. Emergency relief money was given directly to people through state and local agencies.</p>
<p class="indent">To give jobs to many of the 14 million unemployed, public work projects were started. The National Recovery Administration attempted to guide business and industry in limiting production and ending unfair competition, until the National Industrial Recovery Act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The Tennessee Valley Authority built dams, began a conservation programme, and supplied cheap electricity to people in seven states. Social security was created providing payments to the elderly, insurance for the jobless, and aid to dependent mothers and children. Minimum wages were established. <a id="calibre_link-475" class="calibre10"></a>The Roosevelt administration also attempted to have farmers limit production to increase farm income. Although it was only World War II that brought full recovery to the US, the New Deal made reforms in business and industry, helped labour, and restored confidence</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is ‘New Deal’?</b></i></span> The term ‘New Deal’, though never properly defined, became the label for anti-depression measures of Roosevelt’s first two terms as President of the USA. His supporters held that the New Deal signified the most imaginative burst of federal domestic legislation in American history. His critics contended that it was nothing more than a miscellany of alphabetical agencies which failed to end the World Depression of 1929&ndash;32.</p>
<p class="indent">On the eve of Roosevelt’s assumption of office in March 1933, the nation faced an economic crisis of enormous proportions, caused by the Depression. Most of the country’s banks, weakened by the withdrawal of funds by frightened depositors, were closed. More than 14 million people were unemployed. Other serious repercussions were unstable agricultural prices, reduced production, reduced wages, large scale hoarding, export of gold deposits, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">The main aim of the US administration under Roosevelt was to attack and solve this economic crisis. To do so, Roosevelt felt that he would have to carry out experiment to find the practical approach. Hence his New Deal programmedid not have a defined economic philosophy. It was opportunistic rather than hypothetical in its approach to problems. However, it was consistent in some ways. It had humanitarian goals, an openness to new ideas, and an inclination to expand federal powers to achieve its objective. It proposed to provide relief for the needy, recovery for the nation at large and long range reform of some economic institutions. The New Deal in effect was, therefore, a programme of ‘Relief, Recovery and Reform’.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">How was Relief Provided?</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The relief component of the New Deal led to the foundation of a host of administrative agencies between 1933&ndash;35. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) eventually employed 2.5 million young men on conservation and reforestation projects. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) and the Civil Works Administration (CWA) spent more than $ 2 billion on doles and work relief between 1933 and 35. The Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) helped thousands of property owners and lending institutions throughout the decade. His administration also removed the nation from the gold standard in 1933 and implemented mildly inflationary monetary policies in 1933&ndash;34. These efforts provided some relief to debtors.</p>
<p class="indent">The most important relief agency of the New Deal was the Works Progress Administration (WPA) set up in 1935. During the next eight years, it built or improved more than 2,500 hospitals, 5,900 school buildings, and almost 13,000 playgrounds. It gave funds for federal theatre, arts and writers’ projects that enriched the nation’s cultural life. The WPA’s National Youth Administration gave financial aid to more than 2 million high school and college students and to 2.6 million young people who were not in school. Most of the WPA’s money amounting to $ 11 billion in all by 1943, went for short-term, make-work projects to assist the unemployed. At peak periods, the WPA helped more than 3 million people.</p>
<p class="indent">These relief agencies signified an unprecedented federal involvement in welfare. The millions of Americans who benefitted from them, especially blacks and other minorities, showed their gratitude by lionizing Roosevelt and by voting Democratic in subsequent elections. The relief policies of the New Deal also stored up confidence in the Nation’s political institutions and to belittle the agitations growing since 1929.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-476" class="calibre10"></a>However, it should be remarked that the relief measures did not produce the desired results. Even at its peak, the WPA failed to reach 7 million unemployed and their families, and it gave hopelessly low wages. Unemployable, such as the sick, the crippled, the aged, and dependent children were left at the mercy of the states, which were often unable or unwilling to help. So, the New Deal relief measures can at the most be described as partially successful.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was Recovery Achieved?</b></i></span> The New Deal’s main recovery programmes included the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), the National Recovery Administration (NRA), and the Public Works Administration (PWA), all set up in 1933 at special session of the Congress. Unlike the relief agencies, these recovery programmes were primarily meant for the long-term goal of stabilising and improving agriculture, business and employment.</p>
<p class="indent">The AAA’s primary solution to low farm prices was domestic allotment &ndash; a programme that motivated commercial farmers to cut down production of basic crops and livestock. Reductions in supply were supposed to encourage market prices. Cooperating farmers received federal subsidies. Because of disastrous droughts in some areas, the AAA eventually succeeded in limiting supply and raising farm prices by 50% in Roosevelt’s first term. In this way, it provided succour to large commercial farmers in the regions unaffected by drought. However, the AAA created troubles for tenants, many of whom were removed from the land by acreage quotas, and for consumers, who had to pay more for food and clothing. The critics argued that the New Deal caused agricultural scarcity when millions of people faced shortages in food and clothing.</p>
<p class="indent">The NRA was a trial in government-business cooperation. It made business and labour leaders to sign codes of fair competition within their industries. The codes established norms for pricing and production and assured labour the rights of collective bargaining, minimum wages, and maximum hours. The NRA, despite a beginning, lost its effectiveness. Trade union leaders complained that the courts nullified the labour guarantees. Progressives argued that monopolies were excluded from anti-trust prosecution. Small businessmen maintained that the codes were favourable to large corporations. By 1934 evasion of the codes was rampant, and industrial recovery was slow. In 1935, the US Supreme Court nullified the NRA by stating that the code making provisions amounted to an unwarranted transfer of legislative authority to the President. By that time, the NRA lost its utility.</p>
<p class="indent">The TWA, which had an initial budget of $ 3.3 billion, facilitated in building scores of court-houses, sewage plants, bridges, hospitals and city halls in the 1930s. In a restricted way it constructed public housing for the poor. It distributed huge sums of money without a single scam. Still its prudence in spending money made the PWA a poor engine for recovery. Rather than pumping money quickly into the economy, it procrastinated till there was certainty that the amounts would be properly used. Enhanced purchasing power, essential for prosperity, was therefore sluggish to develop, and the pace of industrial recovery slowed down accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How were Reforms Instituted?</b></i></span> Under the New Deal, several reform measures were enacted, the important among them being the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) which helped prevent banking panics; the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which paved the way for federal regulation of stock exchanges; and the Banking Act of 1935, which increased Washington’s control over monetary policy. These legislations reduced the chances of future depressions as harsh as the one of 1929&ndash;32.</p>
<p class="indent">The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), set up in 1933, was a significant New Deal <a id="calibre_link-477" class="calibre10"></a>achievement. It was involved in the manufacture of fertilisers, in soil conservation, and in social experiments with state and local agencies. Its most prominent achievement was the building of multipurpose dams to control floods and generate cheap electric power throughout the region drained by the Tennessee River and its tributaries. The TVA did refrain from broadranging social experimentation, but improved the standards of living of millions.</p>
<p class="indent">The New Deal also brought about a change in the nature of labour management relations. Labour leaders, inspired temporarily by passage of the NRA in 1933, believed that Roosevelt would not use government to suppress unions. Accordingly, they carried out successful organising drives throughout the 1930s. They also agitated for the Wagner Act, passed in 1935. This important law set up the National Labour Relations Board, which guaranteed to labour the right to bargain collectively on equal terms with managements.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1938, the New Dealers helped in the enactment of the Fair Labour Standards Act. The Act stipulated minimum wages and maximum hours for certain types of work and banned child labour involved in inter-state commerce. Despite the exclusion of many workers from coverage, the act proved to be a cautious step towards federal supervision of labour conditions. Partly due to the generously neutral attitude of the New Deal and partly due to the leadership of the militant labour leaders, union membership in the USA multiplied from 3.2 million in 1932 to 9 million in 1940. This was the decade’s most significant social change. Another lasting achievement of the New Deal was the passage of the Social Security Act of 1935. For, it made the federal government to take up social welfare programmes like old-age pensions, unemployment insurance and assistance to the needy, blind and disabled persons and to dependent children. The act was conservative in many aspects: regressive payroll taxes paid for the blind, disabled and dependent. Nevertheless, the Social Security Act provided a base for later expansion of federally assisted social services. It was the beginning of America’s partial welfare state.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was New Deal Implemented During Second Term?</b></i></span> Though the New Deal programmes suffered from several limitations, the US economy recovered to certain extent during the first term of Roosevelt (1933&ndash;36). Hoping for more, the voters returned Roosevelt to office in 1936 for a second term. The president then committed the blunder of asking for legislation allowing him to ‘pack’ the conservative Supreme Court (which had also found the AAA and some other New Deal legislation unconstitutional) with up to six new judges. At the same time, militant workers resorted to sit down strikes in factories. These events scared both conservatives and moderates in the Congress and placed New Dealers on the on the back foot. Though Congress permitted modest appropriations to aid tenant farmers and to support public housing, it opposed majority of the New Deal initiative during Roosevelt’s second term.</p>
<p class="indent">The biggest setback to the New Deal was the sharp economic recession that occurred in late 1937 and negated most of the gains of 1933&ndash;36. This recession was principally the outcome of cuts in federal spending that Roosevelt, a fiscal conservative, had undertook early in the year to reduce budgetary deficits. Jolted by the slump, Roosevelt deferred until April 1938 before recommending improved spending. His procrastination confirmed the uncertainty and inconsistency of New Deal fiscal policy throughout the 1930s. Till the government significantly increased its spending in 1939&ndash;40 particularly for national defence, the Great Depression did not show any major signs of abating.</p>
<p class="indent">This fiscal conservatism was suggestive of a general political caution characteristic of the <a id="calibre_link-478" class="calibre10"></a>New Deal. Afraid of antagonising the Southern Congressmen, Roosevelt extended no support to civil rights legislation. He made only half-hearted and short-lived efforts to help tenant farmers, provide for public housing, or to redistribute wealth through higher taxes on the rich.</p>
<p class="indent">Although he gave lip service to trust-busting in his second term, he did not strive to stem the tide of corporate concentration. Throughout the 1930s, the New Deal was opportunistic and realistic. Rather than working against, it cooperated with large commercial farmers and big business. It appreciated voluntarism, decentralisation, and states’ rights.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Outcome?</b></i></span> It is generally agreed that the New Deal did not accomplish all that Roosevelt and his supporters had desired. Some of the measures failed totally, or at the most only partially successful, such as the Farmers’ Relief Act which though helped big farmers, rendered many farm labourers jobless. Though unemployment was reduced (8 million in 1937 as against 14 million in 1933), it still remained a serious problem. It was only the war effort that brought unemployment below the one million mark in 1943.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet, it must be conceded that the New Deal achieved a lot. In the initial period, its main achievements were providing relief for the destitute and jobless and creating millions of extra jobs. Consequently, confidence was restored in the government, and according to some, it probably prevented a violent revolution. The public works schemes and the TVA provided services of permanent value, and much of the rest initiated long term developments &ndash; welfare benefits, national direction of resources, collective bargaining between workers and management &ndash; which are all today taken for granted. Never before had an American intervened so directly in the lives of ordinary people, and never before had so much attention been focussed on an American President. Roosevelt’s chief achievement was to rescue the two seemingly contrasting concepts of democracy and free enterprise at a time when other crisis-ridden states were going over to fascism and communism.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides, the New Deal facilitated change in both politics and political institutions. Democrats, formerly an awkward coalition of differing elements, became the advocates of urban liberalism and swept to power in much of the North and Midwest. Henceforth, the Democratic Party occupied majority status in the USA. Under the New Deal, the executive branch, and the presidency especially, also became much more active and innovative than ever. The states and localities themselves gained in the course of administering federal programmes and appropriating funds for matching-grant programmes. Interest groups, already strong before 1933, widened their lines of contact with these expanding governmental entities. In this fashion, the New Deal, though of doubtful value economically, initiated long-range trends towards governmental expansion and modernisation.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-62"><b class="calibre9">RISE OF MILITARISM IN JAPAN</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Japanese had entered World War I primarily to exploit what seemed to be a golden opportunity. They easily occupied the German islands in the Pacific and the German holdings on the Shantung peninsula. The Japanese also had plans for the mainland China, as evident in their 21 demands on China (January 1915), and in their expeditionary force to Siberia, which stayed back after the British and American troops left in 1920. These ambitious plans were, mostly unrealised. At the Paris Peace Conference, Japan managed to keep control of the former German islands, but as Class ‘C’ mandates rather than as out right possessions. President Wilson vigorously opposed Japanese claims to the Chinese Shantung peninsula. As <a id="calibre_link-479" class="calibre10"></a>a compromise, Japan was allowed to retain temporary possession of the peninsula, but it agreed reluctantly to restore the territory to China in future, retaining only the economic privilege earlier enjoyed by Germany.</p>
<p class="indent">At the Washington Naval Conference, Japan officially renounced any territorial ambitions it may still have desired. The nine powers at the conference signed a Nine-Power Treaty (February 6, 1922) assuring the territorial integrity of China and upholding the principle of the Open Door. At the same conference, the United States, Britain, France, and Japan signed the Four-Power Treaty (December 13, 1921) by which they consented to respect one another’s rights in “insular possessions” in the Pacific and to resolve any future disagreements by negotiations. Besides, Japan, due to energetic American intercession, agreed to restore Shantung to China and to evacuate its troops from Siberia. Both commitments were carried out in 1922.</p>
<p class="indent">After indulging in the above foreign adventures, for a while Japan focussed on domestic economic problems. Japan, like the United States, had grown tremendously during World War I, supplying munitions and merchant shipping. Between 1914 and 1920, the value of foreign trade almost quadrupled. But the prosperity was not evenly distributed because of the exceptional concentration of economic power in the so-called Zaibatsu (Zai means wealth, batsu, clique). The peasants, amounting to fifty per cent of the total population, were very poor due to high rents and heavy debts. A mere seven per cent of these families were owners of five acres or more of land, with the average holding being less than three acres. Urban workers were victims of high food prices, low wages, and lack of trade union freedom.</p>
<p class="indent">The miserable living standards of the workers and peasants had an adverse impact on the domestic market. As a result, Japanese industry became over dependent on foreign markets for the disposal of its manufactures. This dependence caused disaster due to onset of the Depression. Between 1929 and 1931, foreign trade fell by almost 50 percent. The peasants, who had augmented their paltry incomes by silk cultivation, were badly hit by the quick fall in silk exports to Depressionridden USA. City workers similarly reeled under unemployment.</p>
<p class="indent">Military brass and other votaries of territorial aggrandisement argued convincingly that the root of Japan’s trouble was its over dependence upon foreign markets. Japan should establish an empire that would make it economically self-reliant in the world. Military spokesmen had been advocating this doctrine for years, but the repercussions of the Depression now presented them a responsive audience, as in the case of Hitler in Germany. The Japanese militarists were not only goaded by economic considerations, but were also worried about the growing strength of the Soviet Union and the increasing success of Chiang Kai-shek in unifying China. Besides, they were burdened with unemployment situation and other problems that were then engrossing the attention of Western statesmen. These factors played a crucial role in the Japanese decision to invade the Chinese province of Manchuria in 1931.</p>
<p class="indent">Manchuria did not accidentally become the first target of Japanese expansionism. This Northeastern province of China was not only linked with the central Nanking government and but also abundantly endowed with natural resources, including iron, coal and extensive fertile plains. Moreover, Japan had acquired through past treaties several special privileges in Manchuria. These could be utilised to look for pretexts for justifying aggressive measures.</p>
<p class="indent">Taking advantage of a minor incident in South Manchuria (an explosion which destroyed a small portion of the railway track <a id="calibre_link-480" class="calibre10"></a>north of Mukden on September 18, 1931), Japan occupied Mukden and Changchun within twenty-four hours and then spread out in all directions. By taking Harbin in late January 1932 all organised resistance came to an end in Manchuria. In March 1932, the Japanese rechristened their conquest ‘Manchukuo’ (the state of Manchu). Since they required a puppet emperor, they persuaded Henry Pu Yi, the last surviving member of the old Manchu dynasty that had fallen in 1911, to formally sit on the throne.</p>
<p class="indent">In the meantime, the Chinese government had complained to the League of Nations under Article 11, and to the United States under the Paris Pact (Kellogg&ndash;Briand Pact). But there was too much deliberation and no practical help. The League Council met several times to discuss the Manchurian situation. On November 21, the Japanese delegation upheld the original Chinese proposal for an impartial Commission of inquiry, but the members were not chosen until January 14, 1932, and they did not reach Mukden until April 21. By that time, Manchuria had become Manchukuo.</p>
<p class="indent">The League Commission, called the Lytton Commission after its chairman, Lord Lytton, gave its report in October 1932. Cautiously worded so as not to offend the Japanese, it termed the Japanese aggression as an unjustifiable act and held the new Manchukuo state a Japanese puppet regime. On the other hand, it stopped short of asking Japan to get out. Instead, the report sought solution in recognising Japan’s special interest in Manchuria and making that province an autonomous state under Chinese sovereignty but with the Japanese in control. On February 25, 1933, after the League accepted the report, Japan walked out of the body within a month.</p>
<p class="indent">With hindsight, the Manchurian affair appears as the first serious blow delivered to the League of Nations and at the whole diplomatic system organised to maintain the status quo &mdash; Versailles’ Settlement, the Washington Conference agreements and the Paris Pact. The manner in which Japan had obtained its rich new possession was not lost upon the right-wing leaders of Italy and Germany; Manchuria inaugurated a chain reaction of aggressions that eventually led to World War II.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Nature of Miltarism In Japan?</b></i></span> The period after decline of Feudalism saw the creation of a modern, centrally governed state, the enormous development of the economy and industry and military domination at home and rapid conquests and expansion, ending in a national disaster of the greatest magnitude, the destruction of most Japanese cities, the surrender of armed forces and foreign occupation of the century. Japan’s war with China marked the end of the restoration period and the beginning of a new age, the period of Japanese Militarism and Asian expansion.</p>
<p class="indent">Modernisation of Japan, combined with a sense of national pride, the growth of population, the industrial development, etc., had contributed to the rise of Militarism in Japan. It was during the late 1920s and the early 1930s that a new tide of Militarism coupled with Nationalism swept through Japan, which took alarming proportions by 1937. This new tide of Nationalism was because of the right wing political parties and the army and their historic role in shaping Japan into a war country. The army which predominantly dominated the Japanese politics was thinking of war conquest; its officers highly educated, but with little knowledge of international politics advocated expansion of the empire by force of army, which culminated into a national disaster after the World War II.</p>
<p class="indent">Militarism in Japan satisfied all the features of European Fascism. Japanese Militarism, like Fascist movements in Europe, was anti-democratic and authoritarian in nature. It was dominated by the military warlords who <a id="calibre_link-481" class="calibre10"></a>concluded that Japan’s interests could be satisfied only under a totalitarian regime. Thus, the power came increasingly under the war minister and the Navy minister who generally dominated the Japanese politics.</p>
<p class="indent">The totalitarian feature of Japanese Militarism also meant that it was not a peaceful movement and anti-war but vice versa, dominated by ultra-nationalism. Ultra-nationalists started operating in Japan to reduce the influence of liberal organisations. An ultra-nationalist society was started in 1910; then came the Greater Japan Nationalist Society in 1919. They began to attack the corruption prevailing among the political parties and the Zaibatsu. It was argued that a glorious future lay ahead of Japan if control of power was given to the army, the only incorruptible force in Japan.</p>
<p class="indent">Another striking feature of Japanese Militarism was that it was ant-communist and hence pro-capitalist. Russia was the natural enemy of Japan as their interests clashed over Manchuria and other parts of Asia. Time and again, both the countries clashed and these took some serious ideological differences. Since the rise of Bolsheviks, the relations between these two countries were never good. Apart from this, Japan was also concerned with the colonial expansion based on capitalist lines which was seriously resented by Russia at various times. This probably was one main feature that made Japan to sign Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, both of whom stood for Capitalism.</p>
<p class="indent">Though these are some of the features common to all the right-wing regime of contemporary world, yet Japan retained some original features exclusive to its Militarism. The Japanese totalitarianism retained a Japanese pattern shaped by the absence of individualism, and no ‘Further’ or ‘Duce’ emerged. Surprisingly, it still retained some principles of democracy especially borrowed from western nations; personality cult was absent here and the emperor (Micado) was still recognised as a symbol of unity and a common rallying point ‘for the whole nation.’</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did it Rise?</b></i></span> After the restoration, Japanese politics was for some time dominated by oligarchies. Later the equation enlarged and she was dominated political parties, bureaucracy and the Zaibatsu. Zaibatsu played an important role from World War I when they started to cultivate intimacy with the political parties and the bureaucracy. The first political part was ‘Jiyu-To’ or liberal party out of which came the ‘Seiyukai’ in 1881. During the first general elections of 1890, ten political factions were formed. The Seiyukai obtained an absolute majority in 1920 elections under conservative Hara. He tried to replace military heads by civilians in the colonies. He also resisted labour movement and social legislation and was believed to be corrupt. His party lasted only for six months after his death in 1921. The next party of importance was ‘Minseito’ which advocated a moderate programme of peaceful expansion of foreign trade, a policy of consolidation in dealing with foreign countries and domestic retrenchment. The ‘Seiukai’, on the other hand, stood for positive programme of energetic diplomatic and military activity. In 1924, Tanaka, the leader of Seiyukai party became the premier of Japan and he stressed on the Japanese hegemony in Asia, but had to bow down because of the opposition of Zaibatsu in 1929. Minseito which came to power under Mamaguchi was strongly criticised for its domestic as well as foreign policies. It failed to tackle the World Depression, and failed in international affairs by accepting the London Treaty which contained the naval power of Japan. A young fanatic shot Hamaguchi in 1930, and in December 1931 Seiyukai came to power, but Inukai its premier was assassinated putting an end to democratic institutions in Japan.</p>
<p class="indent">The political parties in Japan were grounded in personal loyalties and were not dedicated <a id="calibre_link-482" class="calibre10"></a>to the party principles. Besides, there were a number of splinter groups that did not hesitate to shift their political allegiance. On account of this weakness of the political parties, the aristocracy, the bureaucracy and the military was aided by the Zaibatsu, controlled the government. The clandestine affairs between the political parties and the business giants made the people not only to be cautious but also suspect Zaibatsu and the political parties. The drift towards Fascism could have stopped if political parties, Minseito and Seiyukai, had unity among them. Even in a critical period like this they fought with each other which led only to their own ruin.</p>
<p class="indent">Ever after the Restoration, the ‘Samurai’ had always played a significant role in Japanese politics. Right from 1895 to 1945, the military clique retained real control, the power being in the hands of War Minister and Navy Minister, both being military officers. With the rise of parliamentary government, the bureaucracy, political parties and Zaibatsu checked the power of the army but could never destroy it entirely. The internal balance shifted toward the army when bureaucracy shifted its allegiance from the parties to the army. This new combination ruled Japan for more than a decade from 1920 to 1930s. Before assuming full power the army had to resolve its inner conflicts between two factions&mdash;imperial faction and the control faction. The first group led by junior officers believed in direct action and in elimination of Zaibatsu. The second group consisting of high ranking officers was against direct action and terrorist methods. It was this group which ultimately captured power. The financial clique that had backed the political parties now realised that the parties had lost their popular support, and wasted no time in adjusting themselves with the army’s programme rather than fight it. Thus, by 1941 Japan was completely under the dominance of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, an exclusive and official political party controlled by the army.</p>
<p class="indent">In the late 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and early 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> centuries, imperialism was not condemned instead it was admired and approved. The western nations were engaged in the scramble for colonies in Asia and Africa. If Japan wanted to be recognised as modern power, she had to show that she also can become an imperialist power, superior to the weak neighbours and also willing to control them. It is also interesting to see that the various parties and politicians who most vigorously opposed this were also most active and vocal advocates of war, conquests and acquisition of colonies. The Japanese were also convinced that their rulers were right to claim that only force mattered in international affairs. These imperialist designs of Japan were further strengthened because of its rapid industrialisation. Heavy industries such as steel, machinery and ship building started growing even before the World War I. Now the emphasis was on increasing the production. In the beginning, the availability of cheap labour put Japan in a favourable position in world markets. Japan had sufficient coal, hydro-power and copper, but lacked iron-ore. Hence she depended upon import of ore for her agricultural and chemical industries. Japan, thus, naturally needed suppliers of raw materials and market. This economic necessity explains to a large extent the colonial policy followed by Japan between the two wars. With the acquisition of Manchuria, and certain provinces of China, she got control over the resources of raw materials and markets. The growing population of Japan needed an outlet and her colonies fulfilled this need.</p>
<p class="indent">Various secret societies like Black Ocean Society and the Black Dragon Society supported the militarists. In addition to these, militaristic societies like Ex-servicemen’s Association propagated militarism in every book and corner of the country. They controlled the education <a id="calibre_link-483" class="calibre10"></a>based on ultra-nationalistic lines, and wholeheartedly supported the expansionist policy of Japan. A justification given for heavy taxation was that it was necessary for military budget.</p>
<p class="indent">America with the consent of England decided to call a disarmament conference to discuss the problems of East Asia and the Pacific. It produced three treaties and adopted several resolutions in 1921. One of the treaties provided to stop the ruinous naval competition, which greatly checked the Navy of Japan. This was a dissatisfied agreement Japan had to enter.</p>
<p class="indent">The repeal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the passage of American Immigration Law further restricting Japanese immigration, the inferior Naval ratio (London Naval Agreement, 1930), and the like developments in the twenties further aroused the pride of the sentimental Japanese. This gradually developed into a feeling of insecurity when Britain started construction of a naval base at Singapore evidently directed against Japan. Japan which was isolated now, thought to break the ring and it struck Manchuria in 1931. These were the factors which led Japan to expand its frontiers.</p>
<p class="indent">Inukai Tsu-Yoshi became the Prime Minister in 1931. His cabinet supported the army activities in Manchuria. Large military appropriations were made. Many people were killed, which was the work of a group of army officers and cadets who called themselves ‘Blood Brotherhood’. In May 1932, Inukai was assassinated. After this, till 1941 almost nine cabinets changed. The Japanese followed the dictates of military leaders because of the crisis, which many believed could be solved effectively by the army in the domestic political situation. It is perhaps because of this that that Japanese welcomed the militarist cabinets till 1942.</p>
<p class="indent">Earlier, by 1929, Japan had not closed the gap between imports and exports. So the Japanese government followed a policy of encouraging less consumption and more production. The World Depression of 1929 had affected Japan; its exports dropped by more than 30%. In order to achieve the recovery, Japan adopted an inflationary policy in 1931. Instead of increasing taxes to balance the budget, it increased currency circulation. This devalued the Yen. Gradually Japan could recover and its exports had increased by 20% by 1936. Depression hit hard the agriculture sector. Many peasants went to join the army. The military officers, on the other hand, wanted to relieve the pressure of the farmers in Japan by expanding the Japanese territories into Manchuria and China. They openly propagated that the Japanese occupation of Manchuria could alone solve the varied economic problems.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did it Grow?</b></i></span> The attempts of the militarists to capture power in Japan reached a turning point when Minseito party won the elections in 1936. Four days after the election results, some junior officials led a regimental revolt in Tokyo to overthrow the government. Though this coup ended in a failure, the power of the militarists increased and the moderates realised that there was nothing that could stop the extremists. They conceded the restoration of the practice that the war minister and the navy minister had to be military officers on active service; a major triumph of militarists.</p>
<p class="indent">The Hirota Cabinet accepted the sevenpoint programme, called ‘National Political Renovation’. By it, the government was committed to expand armament, the stock piling of the materials of war, giving full support to the Japanese army in Manchuria and rigid control of education. This meant that the government was under the control of the military.</p>
<p class="indent">In November 1936, Japan signed Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany. Later Italy joined it. This ended the diplomatic isolation of Japan and increased the influence of right extremists in the country. Japan thus headed towards a military dictatorship that seemed to have been a tide towards Totalitarianism.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-484" class="calibre10"></a>The National Mobilisation Act of 1938 virtually ended the parliamentary government in Japan. This enabled bureaucracy to take power from legislature. Military was highly successful and it completed the totalitarian structure in the country. Military now controlled the industry, prohibited strikes and disputes, and made mediation compulsory in both cases.</p>
<p class="indent">All the above Acts and culminated into a single party dominance by 1941. Imperial Rule Assistance Association, an exclusive official party controlled by the army, took Japan to the war front.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Outcome?</b></i></span> Japan followed an aggressive policy towards Manchuria from 1930s onwards. Manchuria was a vast territory, with abundant economic resources. It is much not only in agricultural products but also rubber, coal, iron and gold mines. Manchuria was considered strategically important. Naturally China claimed it to be part of her, but had been subjected Russian and Japanese control. Chinese nationalist Kuo-min Tang (KMT) government considered Manchuria as the ‘first line’ of the defence of their country, while the Japanese considered it as ‘life line’. The Lio-tung Peninsula came to Japan, after the Russo-Japanese war, for a period of 99 years.</p>
<p class="indent">The South Manchuria railway came to be controlled by Japan, which slowly crept into the administration and political factions in that area. This was followed by a series of events like Korean presence in Manchuria, attempts to build parallel railroads, China’s refusal to repay loans of 150 million yen and the assassination of a Japanese captain in 1931, which ultimately culminated in the invasion of Manchuria. The immediate pretext was the destruction of a section of South Manchurian Railway in a bomb explosion, the Japanese reacted to this by seizing Mukden. In three months, the Japanese extended their authority in almost the whole of Manchuria. On the appeal of China, the League of Nations issued an order to withdraw from the territory, but Japan ignored it. Later Japan expanded its colonial tentacles to Inner Mongolia (1933) and Northern China (1935). In 1933, Japan withdrew from the League and continued with its aggrandisement.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1935 Hirota, the P.M. of Japan, proposed a three point programme to settle the Sino-Japanese dispute, which had become a crisis especially after the 1935 Northern China conflict. According to the programme, it proposed to end anti-Japan activity, recognise Manchukuo and to accept help in suppressing communism. However, the anti-Japanese feeling increased in China. The Chinese nationalists and the communists joined hands and the Japanese property in China was destroyed. On July 7, 1937 a local feud broke out between Chinese and Japanese forces. Thus started what is known as the ‘Undeclared War’ on China. Japan tried to destabilise the KMT government and tried to establish a popular government on the lines of Manchukuo. However, its authority was questioned in many parts of china. Finally, Japan resorted to economic blockade of China in 1939, and this war assumed serious proportions on account of World War II. The rise of Hitler and Mussolini had posed great danger to the democracies of the World. Japanese activities were also looked with suspicion by Britain, America and other powers. The relations with Russia were already strained because of Mongolia. As a result, Japan was isolated. It was this isolation which brought Japan close to Nazism and in the pact that followed (Anti-Comintern) in 1936, they agreed to suppress the menace of communism. A year later Italy joined it. In 1940 the tripartite countries signed a pact which agreed to mutual cooperation in recognising Japan, mutual military aid in the event of war, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1939, World War II broke out and Japan announced that she was not interested in the European struggle. However, in 1910 after the fall of Holland, France and Belgium, Britain <a id="calibre_link-485" class="calibre10"></a>entered the fray. Now Japan exploited the situation thoroughly. It extracted a humiliating agreement from China and secured the right of sending troops into China. Japan also requested a large share of oil, rubber and thin form Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p class="indent">Japan was very successful in the war initially. In 1941, England and Netherlands declared war on Japan. With the help of China, Japan took over Hong Kong in 1941. Japan continued her victories and conquered Manila, Malaya, Singapore, Dutch Indies and Burma in 1942. Though Japan had no war directly with the USA, Japan was hit by USA’s embargo which made the Japanese to declare war against the USA and bombed the Pearl Harbour (1941).</p>
<p class="indent">These initial victories were put to an end by England and the USA when they defeated Japanese near Philippines in 1943. Now the allies attacked Japan itself and with Yalta Conference, USSR entered the war against Japan, Russia invaded Manchuria; in Europe Hitler was defeated; Americans tightened the blockade on Japanese islands and on August 6, the USA dropped the first atom bomb on Hiroshima and the second on August 9, 1945 on Nagasaki. Japan surrendered unconditionally.</p>
<p class="indent">By the war Japan was almost reduced to ashes. The defeat of Japan resulted in the loss of all her political power and the USA occupied Japan till 1951. Her defeat also resulted in loss of all her colonies, not only those occupied during the World War II, but also all the territorial possessions she had acquired since Meiji Restoration &mdash; islands of Kuriles, Shakalin, etc., to the USSR, Manchuria and Formosa to China, Korea to USA and USSR.</p>
<p class="indent">The impact of war was severe on Japan. As such it was in deplorable condition even during the war. The imports were almost entirely cut off, and she suffered an estimated destruction of 30% of urban property and a loss of 3.5 lakhs of human lives.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-63"><b class="calibre9">WORLD WAR II: CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">A great controversy is still going on about the origins or who and what was responsible for the Second World War. The Versailles Settlement had been held responsible for making the Germans bitter and vengeful; the League of Nations and the idea of collective security have been found fault with due to their failure to secure general disarmament and to control potential aggressors; the World Depression has been cited, since without it Hitler would probably not have been there. All of them were undoubtedly responsible for creating the kind of tensions which might well lead to war, but something more was obviously needed for the war. Besides, it should also be kept in mind that by the end of 1938 most of the grievances of Germany had been redressed. Reparations, for instance, were largely cancelled; the disarmament clauses had been ignored; the Rhineland was remilitarised; Austria and Germany were united, and 3.5 million Germans had been recovered from Czechoslovakia. England had even offered some compensation for lost German colonies. Then, what was that something more that was needed?</p>
<p class="indent">A large number of historians blame Hitler for the War. For Hitler wanted not only to destroy Poland but also to conquer and annex Russia. Others, however, feel that the policy of appeasement of other great powers like England and France towards Nazi Germany was equally to blame. These powers should have taken a tough stand with Hitler before Germany had become too strong. An Anglo-French attack, for instance, on Western Germany in 1936 at the time of the Rhineland occupation would have taught Hitler a lesson. Surprisingly, even the Soviet Union has sometimes been accused of making war inevitable by signing the non-aggression pact with Germany. Notwithstanding all this controversy, we may venture to say that Hitler was largely responsible, for it was he who provided that extra something needed for the war. In fact, majority of the historians are in agreement with a prominent German historian who says: “Hitler’s urge to bring things to a head so shaped events that any wish to compromise on the part of the western powers was bound to come to nothing. The entire career was oriented towards War”.</p>

<p class="caption">Japan in World War II</p>
<p class="indent">The war resulted in a massive human carnage and destruction of property both in Europe and Asia. Yet there was no all-inclusive peace settlement of the kind reached at Versailles at the end of World War I. This was so mainly due to the re-emergence of the suspicion and distrust between the USSR and the West in the final months of the War, making a comprehensive settlement impossible. The War, however, stimulated rapid social and scientific developments, the two most significant being the Beveridge Report which was a British plan for introducing a welfare state, and the production of nuclear weapons which have so scaring a potential for death and misery that they must have acted as a deterrent from another global war. Besides as war had a number of other long-term effect which were to set the pattern of world events for the rest of the century, such as the end of European domination of the world, rise of the USA and <a id="calibre_link-487" class="calibre10"></a>USSR as the two Super Powers and their rivalry as seen in the Cold War, acceleration of the process of ‘decolonisation’ in Asia and Africa, birth of the UNO as an organ of World peace and harmony, etc.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Nature of World War II?</b></i></span> The greatest and most destructive war in the history of humanity took place between 1939 and 1945 in which all major countries were involved to prove their superiority over the other. Unlike in the First World War where warfare was conducted primarily on the European continent, this Second World War included gigantic struggles not only in Europe, but in Asia, Africa, and the far-flung islands of the Pacific Oceans as well. Its course strained the economic capabilities of the major nations and left many countries on the verge of virtual collapse.</p>
<p class="indent">The war, which was begun by the Germans in September 1939, was later described as the ‘Unnecessary War’ by the British wartime Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. More than once chances did come in the way of the other powers to prevent it, which they failed to grab. Their reasons had varied in details, but basically the cause had been the unwillingness to face the truth &mdash; a belief that peace could be secured by ignoring disagreeable facts. Hitler had never taken the trouble to conceal his objectives; anybody who bothered to read his book, <i class="calibre8">Mein Kampf</i> or listen to his speeches in Germany could have known of them. The conservatives of France and Britain for a long time believed that Hitler, like themselves, was interested only in putting down communism and breaking the power of labour organisations, the Russian Communists felt that they could make him into an ally, and the Americans believed that they could simply contract out of world history.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were its Causes?</b></i></span> The Treaty of Versailles, signed by Germany with the victorious Allies, was an unjustifiable one, as its terms were harsh. Germany, in fact, had no choice but to sign it. Unconditionally, she had to surrender a great part of her territory, and her colonies were forcibly taken away.</p>
<p class="indent">She was also asked to pay a huge war indemnity which she was in no opposition to do. Moreover, her military power was considerably reduced. The treatment meted out to her was, thus, based on the spirit of revenge. Consequently, the treaty created hatred in the minds of all Germans. It was a black spot for them and they wanted to remove it. This, they felt, could be realised only through force and hence the massive rearmament of Germany.</p>
<p class="indent">The harsh treatment meted out to the vanquished, including Germany, was mainly due to the vengeful attitude of France. France did not stop with its revenge after the war; instead in 1923, she captured the German industrial zone of ‘Ruhr’. Prior to this, Germany had to cede to France, according to the terms of the Versailles Treaty, the Valley of Saar, the region which was the major supplier of coal and iron to Germany. The loss of Saar of Ruhr, turned the German democratic rule to military dictatorship.</p>
<p class="indent">Both England and France had large colonies in Asia and Africa, while Germany had been deprived of all her colonies in 1919. Consequently, her industries suffered as it lost the most coveted overseas sources for supply of raw materials as well as markets for her finished goods. Italy too was not satisfied with the spoils from the war, which made her to be on the lookout for colonies. Japan too was searching for colonies for her ballooning population and industrial development. England and France were possessive about their colonies and wanted to prevent Germany or any of her allies from acquiring colonies elsewhere in the world. So, the conflict of the imperialistic designs of different nations was made inevitable. Soon, Japan captured Manchuria, while Italy occupied Abyssinia and Albania. Germany <a id="calibre_link-488" class="calibre10"></a>was not to be left behind and she acquired some territories by force.</p>
<p class="indent">In Germany, the democratic government under Democratic Socialists failed to deliver the goods, finally making way to dictatorship under the Nazis. By 1934, Hitler manoeuvred himself into power and became the dictator of Germany. He out rightly rejected the Treaty of Versailles and enhanced his military strength besides remilitarising the Rhineland. He desired to restore the old glory and prestige to Germany, and thus make it a major super power in the world. It was precisely for this reason that he followed the path of war. In the case of Italy, she joined World War I with high hopes of acquiring more territories, but its results dashed all her hopes. Consequently, dictatorship was established there in 1921&ndash;22 under the leadership of Mussolini. He introduced many reforms and put a new life in the people of Italy by giving military training to them. He wanted to revive the glory of the Old Roman Empire. So, Italy, like Germany, adopted a policy of active aggrandisement. Japan’s ambitions too increased after the World War I. By 1930s, she developed her navy and enhanced her strength tremendously. In the early 30s, the military junta completely took the power into its hands, and under its leadership, Japan launched itself on the path of expansion.</p>
<p class="indent">To the Japanese, the year 1931 seemed a logical time to embark upon this expansionist policy. Raising the slogan of ‘Save Asia from Communism’, they declared that it was their duty to take up a movement against Communism in Asia. Taking advantage of a small incident in South Manchuria, the Japanese moved in. When China appealed to the western powers for support, the USA protested to Japan, but without positive results. Unmindful of the international opinion, Japan created the puppets state of Manchukuo, Jehol and Chahar in China were occupied in 1933 and 1935 respectively. Other neighbouring provinces were added until, in 1936, Japan controlled most of North-Eastern China. Yet, only mild protests came from western powers. Japan’s response to these was to withdraw from the League. In April 1934, Japan announced a Japanese version of ‘Monroe Doctrine’ which stated that henceforth she would be ‘guardian of the peace of the Pacific’. In 1936, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which was joined by Italy a year later. Meanwhile, she continued her aggression in China. Shanghai and Nanking were taken and, in 1939, South China was invaded and most of the coastline occupied. The outbreak of war in Europe fitted neatly with Japanese plans.</p>
<p class="indent">The success of Japan in the Far East greatly influenced the policies of Mussolini: he also sent his forces into Ethiopia in order to emulate his Japanese counterparts. England protested, had discussions with Hitler and put pressure on France. The latter had to withdraw her consent for Mussolini to attack Ethiopia. Through England’s influence, the League took action against Mussolini, but was not successful in checking his aggression. Ignoring the League, he completed the conquest of Ethiopia with a grand flourish.</p>
<p class="indent">Mussolini’s star, already in the ascendant, was soon followed by Hitler’s which was an even brighter one. The latter had plans similar to those of the former. The confusion in international politics during the Ethiopia crisis gave him an opportunity to take his first step&mdash;the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. Further, he signed the Rome&ndash;Berlin agreement, by which Mussolini signed Austria over to Hitler and in return Hitler recognised Mussolini’s conquest of Ethiopia. The two also agreed to form a united front in Spain to oppose Communism. In 1936, he denounced international control of German rivers as provided in the Treaty of Versailles. In 1938, he moved into Austria which provoked a mild protest from England. The next move was against Czechoslovakia. <a id="calibre_link-489" class="calibre10"></a>England agreed that the Czechs would have to give up Sudetenland. This was only an appetiser; it was not enough to satisfy Hitler. So the Munich Conference allowed Hitler to have one fifth of Czechoslovakia. After signing a non-aggression pact with Russia, in August, 1939, Hitler made his move against Poland, which began the World War II.</p>
<p class="indent">The inability of the League of Nations to function as an agency to promote international justice and maintain peace is the greatest disappointment to international-minded people. Its weaknesses are apparent, and its failure to settle the latest disputes makes us question its value. Japan repudiated the League and no effective action was taken against her, in spite of condemnatory evidence presented in the Lytton Report. Germany withdrew from the League and proceeded to violate almost every article of the Treaty of Versailles. The severest blow of all was Italy’s defiance of the League in the conquest of Ethiopia. The general chaotic condition in international affairs that followed the failure of the League was widespread.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">League of Nations, 1920&ndash;46</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the post-World War I period, the USA reverted to its traditional policy of isolation, and kept aloof from the European politics and did not even join the League of Nations, which was ironically the brainchild of President Wilson. Consequently, England all alone could <a id="calibre_link-490" class="calibre10"></a>not prevent France from ill-treating Germany. Germany could never forget the humiliation she had to suffer at the hands of France and hence plunged the whole World once again into darkness. American aloofness helped the military rulers of Germany and Italy to adopt violent and aggressive attitude and they ignored the League easily.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00050.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Hitler aggression upto 1939</p>
<p class="indent">The World War I was followed by several adjustments in the territories of different nations. Many territories were added to such countries which had entirely different cultures. Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc., were such states. The minorities of these states were not satisfied because they failed to get all the facilities for their development. Such people greatly resented the step-motherly treatment meted out to them. The principle of self-determination which was emphasised by allies fanned the fire of nationalism and political freedom among these minorities. When the German subjects of these states revolted, Hitler annexed them on the pretext of helping the Germans. This was a prelude to the World War II.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was it Fought Out?</b></i></span> The bitter struggles and the enormous casualties suffered by Great Britain and France in World War I had made their military leaders to take a defensive attitude with reliance on such permanent fortifications as the Maginot Line and on blockade as means of subduing a resurgent Germany. Placing their faith in the inept League of Nations, both countries neglected the development of armaments and allowed their armed forces to deteriorate. The Germans, on the other hand, smarting under their failure in World War I to capitalise on initial breakthrough of the Allied lines because of lack of sustained power, developed fast, hard hitting ‘tank aeroplane’ forces and the strategy of the ‘blitzkrieg’ (lightening war). Since they had been disarmed by the allies, they were unencumbered by obsolete armaments and could equip their forces with the most modern weapons. As a result, initial German operations met with surprisingly rapid success.</p>
<p class="indent">Hitler, after surprising the World with the announcement of a non-aggression pact with his sworn enemy, the Union, sent his armies across the Polish border on 1<sup class="calibre13">st</sup> September 1939. Britain and France, pledged to support Poland in the event of aggression, declared war on Germany two days later. In less than a month, Poland had been conquered. There followed an inactive period (dubbed the phoney war) that lasted until April 1940. Then, despite Allied intervention, the Germans quickly seized Denmark and Norway. In May, the ‘blitzkrieg’ struck the western front in all its fury. Within six weeks, the British were thrown out of the continent and the French were compelled to surrender. The speed of the advance surprised Hitler, who was not ready to follow his success with an invasion of the British Isles. The Luftwaffe (German air force) called upon to soften the islands and gain air superiority while preparations were made for invasion, met a stunning reverse at the hands of the small but highly competent and brave Royal Air Force. Frustrated in the West, Hitler turned against the USSR in June 1941. In a series of spectacular military manoeuvres several million Russians were captured. He reached the gates of Moscow in December, only to be stopped by bad weather, and Russian reinforcements rushed to defend the city.</p>
<p class="indent">Mussolini, on the other hand, attempted to realise his dream of an Italian Mediterranean Empire. In the last summer and fall of 1940, he launched an offensive from Libya against the British in Egypt invasion of Greece from Albania (which was occupied in 1939). Both enterprises eventually proved disastrous for the Italians and German forces were sent to their rescue. Greece fell to the Germans, but they met stiff British opposition in Africa. In December 1941, Japan thought the time to be ripe to extend her empire into a greater East Asia, which it did rapidly against meagre opposition. It was <a id="calibre_link-491" class="calibre10"></a>the Japanese plan to fortify this area so strongly as to withstand American counter-attacks and eventually gain a negotiated peace based on the status quo. The attacks on Pearl Harbour and the Philippines brought the USA into war and greatly tilted the scales in favour of the Allies.</p>
<p class="indent">The year 1942 witnessed the turn of the tide for the Allies, In June, Japanese naval airpower was destroyed by theAmerican navy in the Battle of Midway. Having been checked at Moscow, Hitler turned to the American navy in the Battle of Midway. Having been checked at Moscow, Hitler turned to the Caucasus, but the Germans were routed and turned back at Stalingrad by the Russians in the closing months of the year. At the same time, the British delivered a blow to the Germans and the Italians at El Alamein that sent them reeling in retreat westward along the African Mediterranean Coast. In Tunisia, they encountered newly landed British and American forces and were expelled from Africa in May 1943.</p>
<p class="indent">The Allies now had the initiative and took the offensive on all fronts with the vast production facilities of the USA in full operation. Resistance was bitter and progress slow though inexorable. From bases in Africa, the Allies invaded and captured Sicily in July&ndash;August 1943. In September, Italy was forced out of the War. British, American and French forces began a methodical and relentless advance up the Italian Peninsula against the Germans, who had been rushed into defend it. After Stalingrad, the <a id="calibre_link-492" class="calibre10"></a>Russians, in a series of alternating offensives, gradually forced the German’s back with heavy losses, until by 1945 they were approaching Berlin.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00077.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Course of world war II in Europe and Africa</p>
<p class="indent">In the wake of a massive build-up of troops, air and naval power and equipment in the British Isles, the combined American, British and French troops landed on the Normandy Coast of France in June 1944 and pressed the Germans back to the west wall. There, in December 1944, the Germans launched a final counter-attack which failed. Aided by troops landed in Southern France from Italy, the Allies forced the Germans back across the Rhine River and deep into Germany. Surrounded from all sides, and their major cities devastated by aerial bombardment, the Germans finally capitulated on 5<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> May 1945. Due to lack of resources, Allied strategy had envisioned the prior defeat of Germany while remaining on the defensive against the Japanese. Only after victory in Europe would the full Allied power be applied to Japan. American industrial production increased so rapidly, however, that limited offensives could be initiated against the Japanese as early as August 1942. Thereafter, a persistent two-pronged offensive steadily pushed the Japanese back. By the fall of 1944, American forces were landing in the Philippines and regained the islands the next spring. Then the island of Okinawa was captured and preparations began for the invasion of the home islands. Meanwhile, the Japanese position in Asia progressively deteriorated. By the summer of 1945, with its navy and air force virtually destroyed, and cut off from sources of supply of much-needed raw materials, the Japanese saw the writing on the wall. The dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Soviet Invasion of Manchuria hastened their decision to surrender which they did on 14<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> August 1945.</p>
<h4 class="h1"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Impact?</b></i></h4>
<p class="noindent">The impact of the World War II was much greater than that of World War I. Vanquished powers like Germany, Japan and Italy were no doubt destroyed, but among the victorious nations, France and England also became much weaker than before and lost most of their former glory and prestige. The political impact could be seen in the rise of two Super Powers and the division of the world into two rival blocks, establishment of the UNO, decolonisation of many Afro-Asian nations, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">World War II spread death and devastation throughout the world to an extent never before experienced. The loss of life can only be generally summarised, an attempt to express the value of property and livelihood destroyed in terms of money is futile; the resulting sums reach astronomic figures that have little, if any, practical meaning. Many big cities along with their beautiful historical buildings were reduced to ashes. It is said that Europe from the Baltic to Black Sea presented a tragic sight of ruined cities, bridges, devastated fields and concentration camps. A large number of persons lost their homes and native lands. They became refugees and suffered untold miseries. Devastated lands and factories brought agricultural and industrial production to a standstill. The prices of things shot up like anything. The scarcity of food, clothing and shelter caused sickness, suffering and death. The war greatly weakened various governments and fought chaos and anarchy everywhere.</p>
<p class="indent">The war resulted in the emergence of the USA and the USSR as the two Super Powers in the world. By the time of the signing of the Axis satellite treaties (Italian, Bulgarian, Rumanian, Hungarian and Finnish Peace Treaties) early in 1947, the two countries were drawing apart. Friction over the treaties with Austria, Germany and Japan and Soviet aggressive designs in Eastern Europe brought increasing tension, and by the end of 1948, their relationship could be considered one of the Cold War. In 1950, armed conflict arose in Korea between Sovietbacked Communist Forces and the UN forces led by the USA. The Cold War between the Soviet Territorial Gains after World War II East and West continued thereafter, with the Communists striving for World domination through subversion and infiltration and the West seeking to frustrate their designs through equally foul means.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-493" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00105.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Soviet Territorial Gains after World War II</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-494" class="calibre10"></a>The vanquished Germany was divided into two parts, viz., East Germany and West Germany. The USSR took control over the eastern part, while England, France, and the USA occupied the western part. Germany’s capital, Berlin, was also divided into two parts. Millions of Germans, both civilian and the military, perished during the war. The German army was reduced and all her war material was snatched away from her. The Allies tried the war criminals and some stalwarts of the Nazi party were executed. Thus, the war resulted in the division of Germany and in the end of Nazism.</p>
<p class="indent">The impact of the war on Italy and Japan was also severe. The Japanese Emperor was deprived of this powers and prestige. The American general, Mac Arthur, was given the complete control of Japan. He set up limited monarchy in Japan. In Italy, Mussolini was removed as early as 1943, and after the war, a democratic government was established. However, both Japan and Italy were deprived of their conquests and colonies. Their military power was reduced and they were forced to pay heavy war indemnity. Thus Fascism in Italy and Militarism in Japan were blotted out.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the allied powers like England and France had also suffered and became weaker than before. The economic loss suffered by England made her a second-rate power in the World. In fact, it lost its supreme position to the USA and the USSR who had now emerged as the two super powers in the world. France also had lost most of her former power and prestige. Besides, it witnesses too much of a political instability after the war, which further undermined her position as a world power. In fact, they became the satellites of USA after the war.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00132.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">NATO and Warsaw pact countries</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-495" class="calibre10"></a>The humanity was awe-struck at the destruction caused by the World War II. There was a general realisation among all the nations of the world (old as well as newly independent nations of Africa and Asia) that peace should be preserved at any cost. This realisation was behind the foundation of the United Nations Organisation in 1945. If there were to be another world war, particularly after the discovery of the atomic bomb, there would be nobody left to see the light of the day and there would be no difference between the vanquished and the victorious. Consequently, every nation became quite willing to extend all possible help to the UNO for establishing and maintaining World Peace.</p>
<p class="indent">World War II gave a boost to Nationalism and started the process of decolonisation in Asia and Africa. The European colonial empires began to crumble one by one partly because of the nationalist movements in the colonies and partly because of the inability of the colonial powers to maintain their former hold on the colonies. The British colonies of India, Burma, Ceylon, Malaya, etc., were granted independence one by one. The East Indies ended the Dutch rule and became the new independent nation of Indonesia. Indo-China also achieved independence from the French. Soon, the English, French, Portuguese, and the Dutch colonies in Africa also became free.</p>

<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The spirit of cooperation between the Western democracies and the Soviet Union was already being deflated by verbal salvos in 1945. Truman denounced the establishment of new governments through force, a clear attack on Soviet policies in Eastern Europe. In February 1946, Stalin described the Western democracies as enemies of communism. In March 1946, Churchill attacked Soviet actions in Eastern Europe and warned against Communist subversion. He described a Russian iron curtain ‘dividing a free and democratic West from an East under totalitarian rule.’</p>
<p class="indent">These accusations focused mainly on developments in Eastern Europe. The United States and its allies felt that wartime agreements and a sense of justice should compel the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern European states, all of which should be independent from Soviet control. The Soviet Union felt that these same wartime agreements and a higher sense of justice recognised the overriding need for the Soviet Union to make sure Eastern European states remained friendly and under Soviet influence. The United States became increasingly outraged when developments in Eastern Europe seemed to go Stalin’s way. In 1945, the Soviets were already exerting control over the governments of Romania and Poland, despite the protests of the British and Americans. By 1947, Soviet dominance in these two countries was solidified and spreading to other Eastern European countries. In 1948, Soviet threats forced non-Communist leaders out of the Czechoslovakian government, placing that country in Communist hands. By 1950, all the states of Eastern Europe were controlled by Communists and, with the exception of <a id="calibre_link-499" class="calibre10"></a>Yugoslavia under Tito, were dominated by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="indent">Struggles over Eastern Europe spread to Western Europe, where strong Communist parties in France and Italy pursued policies approved by Moscow. The United States and its allies feared these parties would subvert non-Communist governments and help spread Soviet control further south and west.</p>
<p class="indent">The verbal denunciations and discord over events in Europe were accompanied by a breakdown of cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. President Truman, who succeeded Roosevelt on April 12, 1945, was in favour of a tougher policy toward the Soviet Union. In May, he cut off aid to the Soviet Union. When the possibility of international control of atomic weapons arose, the Americans and Russians could not agree. This led to the nuclear weapons race, which has flourished ever since. The breakdown of cooperation was most striking in Germany. In accordance with the Potsdam agreements, most of Germany was divided into four occupation zones: American, Russian, British, and French. Berlin, which was in the Russian zone, was divided into four sectors and made headquarters of a four-power coordinating commission. Sharp cleavages soon developed among the occupying powers, particularly between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, having suffered more at the hands of Germany during World Wars I and II than any other major nation, was determined to keep Germany permanently weak and as much as possible under Soviet domination. The United States, on the other hand, having little fear of Germany and seeing it as a valuable potential ally against the Soviet Union, soon set out to restore and rearm the nation. Matters came to a head in 1948&ndash;49. In March 1948, the United States, having succeeded in merging the three western zones and stepping up their economy to a level much higher than that agreed upon at Potsdam, announced plans for the creation of an independent West German state. To the Soviet leaders, this was the last straw. They attempted to dissuade the western powers from going ahead with the project by blockading the three western zones of Berlin in the hope of starving them out. For eleven months, from June 1948 to May 1949, the Soviets stopped all land traffic across their zone from the West to Berlin. The western powers defeated the blockade through a giant airlift. The United States proceeded to set up the German Federal Republic, which began to function in September 1949. One month later, the Soviet Union set up the German Democratic Republic in its zone.</p>
<p class="indent">Policies initiated in 1947 raised the Cold War to a higher level. The immediate occasion prompting the United States to inaugurate a new and harsher policy toward the Soviet Union was the situation in Greece and Turkey, both of which were under severe Soviet pressure. In February 1947, the British government, which had been supporting both Greece and Turkey with troops and money since the end of the war, announced that after March 31, it would be unable to continue to do so. On March 12, 1947, President Truman appeared before Congress and requested authorisation to send American military and civilian personnel into Greece and Turkey. “I believe”, he said, “that it must be the policy of the United States to support free people who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures”. He asked for $400 million to implement the new program and warned that this was only a starter. Congress greeted this announcement with a standing ovation.</p>
<p class="indent">The new policy, which was soon called the ‘Truman Doctrine’, meant that the United States would draw a military ring around the Soviet Union and its satellites from Manchuria to Norway. It was the policy of military containment. All real diplomatic negotiations between the United States and the Soviet</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-500" class="calibre10"></a>Union, of course, ceased immediately. The Soviet Union made no further pretense of withdrawing from the areas of Eastern Europe occupied by its troops; instead, the Soviet Union tightened the iron curtain that it had drawn around them.</p>
<p class="indent">In June 1947, Secretary of State General George Marshall supplemented the Truman Doctrine with the ‘Marshall Plan’: This plan was an offer of comprehensive economic aid to all European countries (except Fascist Spain) who would improve their economies, stabilise their currencies, and cooperate with each other in bringing about general economic recovery. All the countries of Europe except the Soviet Union and its satellites hastened to accept Marshall’s terms and American aid. The Soviet Union regarded the Marshall Plan as an American scheme to shore up Europe’s and its own tottering Capitalism, to lure away the Soviet satellites, and to make the European countries economic dependencies of the United States. The Soviet Union, therefore, forbade the countries of Eastern Europe under its control or influence to participate. Congress voted $5.3 billion as the first of four installments totalling some $17 billion for Marshall Plan aid. In 1949, the United States took the initiative in organising the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which was a firm military alliance among the United States, Canada, and most of the nations of Western Europe against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="indent">In the fall of 1947, the Soviet Union began a series of vigorous moves to counter the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. In September 1947, the Soviet Union set up the Communist Information Bureau, or Cominform, to coordinate policies of the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. This agency was in reality a restoration of the old Comintern, which was the Communist International working for world revolution. The following year the Cominform was supplemented by the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance, a Soviet Marshall Plan. At the same time, the Soviet Union severely tightened its grip on its satellites. The local Communist parties were rigorously purged of moderates and national patriots. The Soviet Union strengthened military ties with its allies, eventually countering NATO with the establishment of the Warsaw Pact organization in 1955. By 1950, one stage of the Cold War was completed. Europe was clearly divided into a Communist camp in the East under the control of the Soviet Union and a non-Communist camp in the West under the leadership of the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">The Cold War would continue in different ways and with varying intensity over the next four decades. Both sides were pitted against each other in a worldwide war of propaganda. Political struggles almost anywhere, whether purely internal matters or not, became potential fields for victory or defeat in a Cold War competition. This competition expanded to the non-Western world and to a variety of fields not usually thought of as political, from the exploration of space to the Olympic games. In 1950, the Korean War shifted the focus of the Cold War from Europe to the non-Western world. It also revealed how real the risk of military combat was in the struggle between Communist and non-Communist forces. In the mid-1950s, there were some signs of relaxation in the Cold War. Stalin died in 1953, and later that year an armistice was signed in Korea. The Soviet government made overtures to the United States to end the Cold War. In 1955, Soviet troops left Austria, which became an independent, neutral state. That same year a conference was held in Geneva between the leaders of Great Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Little of substance was accomplished, but at least it symbolised an effort to solve problems peacefully. Talk of ‘peaceful coexistence’ between the superpowers became popular and seemed confirmed when <a id="calibre_link-501" class="calibre10"></a>the two powers agreed to talks for a nuclear test ban treaty in 1958.</p>
<p class="indent">This apparent thaw in the Cold War was mitigated by some chilling developments. In the same year that Stalin died, John Foster Dulles became United States secretary of state in the new Eisenhower administration. It was his belief that all communism was a Moscow-directed conspiracy bent upon world conquest. The time had come, he proclaimed, to pass over from containment to liberation. The United States tried to apply lessons learned in the struggles over Eastern Europe and Korea to Southeast Asia, where the French had lost to Communist-led insurgents in Vietnam. Efforts to hold a meeting between the American and Soviet heads of state in 1960 broke down amid Cold War accusations. In 1961, irritations over Germany were exacerbated by the construction of the Berlin Wall, sealing off democratic West Berlin from East Berlin and the rest of Communist East Germany. In 1962, the Cuban missile crisis, a Cold War confrontation over the placement of Russian missiles in Cuba, came close to erupting into a real war.</p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, the 1960s and most of the 1970s witnessed a general lessening of tensions in the Cold War. A nuclear test ban treaty between the two powers was signed in 1963, and strategic arms limitation talks were initiated in 1969. After 1969, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were often described by the word <i class="calibre8">detente,</i> emphasising cooperation rather than confrontation.</p>
<p class="indent">In the later 1970s and early 1980s events proved that the Cold War was not over. The increasing ties between Communist China and the United States were perceived as a threat by the Soviet Union. When Jimmy Carter became president in 1977, the Soviet leaders quickly took offense at his insistence on the granting of human rights throughout the world, including the Soviet Union, and they were uncomfortable with his open style of diplomacy. A Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 led to the American boycott of the Olympic Games in 1980 and an embargo on grain shipments to the Soviet Union. The Reagan administration took a much tougher stand toward the Soviet Union and Communism in general, reviving Cold War rhetoric and dramatically increasing arms production. In the 1980s the Polish crisis, American attempts to limit exportation of certain technology and materials by western nations to the Soviet Union, the deployment of new American missiles in Europe, the American Strategic Defense Initiative, and the rejection of the 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty heightened tensions between the two powers. However, since 1985 the new arms limitations talks, the signing of an Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a unilateral reduction of conventional forces in Eastern Europe, a more conciliatory foreign policy, Soviet commitment in internal political and economic reforms, and the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan have contributed to improving relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Meaning?</b></i></span> The Cold War was the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union, each supported by its respective non-Communist and Communist allies, which coloured international relations during the four decades following World War II. On one side, the Soviet Union strove to secure itself from external threats and to spread its version of communism to the border states and elsewhere in the world. On the other side, the United States strove to contain Soviet influence and to counter Communist threats wherever they were perceived throughout the world. It was a war fought in almost all ways except open military conflict, and the threat of military force was always present. At times, the Cold War became violent, but the two superpowers never came together in direct armed combat.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-502" class="calibre10"></a>In 1945, the leaders of the victorious nations were confronted with the tasks of making a lasting peace and restoring a shattered world. From the beginning these tasks were hampered by hostility between the United States and the Soviet Union. This hostility pervaded and poisoned every area of post-war international relations. To understand the nature and origins of the Cold War, one must go back to the conferences held by the Allies during the war and to the legacy of assumptions held by participants in those conferences.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did the Two Blocs Emerge?</b></i></span> Although Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were cooperating allies during most of World War II, they approached each other with differing perceptions and a history of distrust. Since the Communists came to power in Russia in 1917, leaders of the Soviet Union and the capitalist democracies had viewed each other as opponents. As ideologies, Communism and Capitalism had always been in direct opposition. As practiced in the Soviet Union under Lenin and especially Stalin, Communism took a totalitarian form, in sharp contrast to the democracies of Great Britain and the United States. Specific developments between the Russian Revolution of 1917 and World War II added to the hostility between the Soviet Union and the capitalist democracies. During the Russian civil war, the western nations had supported anti-Bolshevik forces with materials and some troops. The United States had not recognised the Bolshevik government until 1933. The Soviet Union had not even been invited to the Munich Conference of 1938. In viewing the rise of Fascist and authoritarian governments during the 1920s and 1930s, many in the western democracies found consolation in the opposition of these governments to communism. The western democracies failed to ally with the Soviet Union in the 1930s against the growing threat of Nazi Germany. In 1939, Stalin entered into an astonishing pact with Hitler, enabling Nazi forces to concentrate on Western Europe during the first years of World War II. Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union and the entry of the United States into the war united Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union as allies more in opposition to Nazi Germany than in agreement over principles or goals. When concrete negotiations for war aims and terms of a settlement took place, the history of hostility, distrust, and fear between capitalist and Communist powers caused problems. These problems would increase after the war when the threat of Nazi Germany no longer held the Allies together.</p>
<p class="indent">The decisions that led to the peace settlements, that helped shape Europe in the immediate post-war years, and laid the groundwork for the Cold War were made in a series of conferences held by the leaders of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The first conference took place in December 1943 at Teheran. There Stalin agreed to enter the war against Japan after the defeat of Germany; and Great Britain and the United States agreed to open a second front in France. The most crucial decision was to reject Churchill’s plan to open a front in Eastern Europe, which would have given Great Britain and the United States more influence over developments there. With British and American forces concentrated in Western Europe, Eastern Europe was open to the advancing Russian troops. The next meeting of the three heads of state was in February 1945 at Yalta. The four main areas of discussion were, (1) the United Nations charter, (2) Germany, (3) Eastern Europe, and (4) Far East. All quickly reached agreement on questions concerning the United Nations charter. They also agreed on most matters concerning Germany: complete denazification with severe punishment for the top Nazis; demilitarisation; the division of the country into four occupation zones; and a long period of occupation by the Allies. There was no agreement on the stiff reparations demanded <a id="calibre_link-503" class="calibre10"></a>by Stalin. In the discussion over Eastern Europe, a sharp cleavage soon developed. Stalin argued that Eastern Europe, already behind Soviet lines, was vital to the Soviet Union’s security. Russia had been invaded through these countries in both world wars and many of them had been Hitler’s allies. Therefore, he asserted, the Soviet Union should maintain a measure of control over these countries. Roosevelt and Churchill insisted that these countries must be given complete independence. These disagreements were not resolved; they were papered over with a general agreement that elections would be held as soon as possible in the liberated states of Eastern Europe but these states were to be friendly to the Soviet Union. In regard to the Far East, Stalin agreed to enter the war within three months after Germany’s surrender in return for islands and port facilities that Japan had earlier taken from Russia and for increased Soviet influence in Korea.</p>
<p class="indent">The last meeting of the heads of state of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union took place in July 1945 at Potsdam. At this conference, Clement Attlee had replaced Winston Churchill as British prime minister and Truman had replaced Roosevelt as the American president. Matters that had already been agreed on were affirmed in greater detail, but there was still no fundamental agreement over Eastern Europe. Despite a general accord to work out peace treaties with the various nations as soon as possible, treaties with Germany’s allies were not signed until February 10, 1947, and a final treaty with Germany was never signed.</p>
<p class="indent">While the war ended in 1945 with a complete victory for the Allies, the basis for post-war problems was already present.” The legacy of distrust and hostility between Communist Russia and the Capitalist West was not eradicated by the temporary period of cooperation during the war years. Decisions and disagreements at the wartime conferences resulted in resentments and accusations on both sides, particularly over Eastern Europe. Faced with the reality of Eastern Europe’s being behind Soviet lines, Great Britain and the United States were at a disadvantage. Europe, though struggling to recover, was already politically divided. Political divisions would merge into Cold War divisions in the years following 1945.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Cold War: US and Soviet Alliances</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Condition of Western Bloc?</b></i></span> Europe faced peace in 1945 politically disorganised and economically crippled. Allied and Soviet occupation forces carved Germany into zones and its capital, Berlin, into sectors. In the international arena, growing antagonism marked the relation between the United States and the Soviet Union, the two nations that controlled the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">When the dust from the last bombs settled over Europe’s cities, the balance sheets of destruction were tallied. Millions of survivors found themselves homeless, having lost their loved ones, often all their personal belongings, and the roofs over their heads. Millions returned home from battlefronts and concentration camps to rubble, with wounds beyond healing. There were no jobs; there was nothing to eat. Peacetime rationing dipped below wartime levels. What was not measured in the statistics on physical and human destruction, at least immediately, was the psychological devastation that succeeded such loss. There could be no returning to life as normal. For many, the war was far gentler than the peace. For these combatants of peacetime, often women and children, digging out and surviving were the greatest battles of all.</p>
<p class="indent">An American military observer reported to his superiors in 1947: “Europe is steadily deteriorating. The political position reflects the economic. One political crisis after another merely denotes the existence of economic distress. Millions of people in the cities are <a id="calibre_link-504" class="calibre10"></a>slowly starving.” Even the winners were losers as survivors faced a level of human and material destruction unknown in the history of warfare. Economists judged that Europe would need at least 25 years to regain its pre-war economic capacity. The worst was also feared: Europe would never recover as a world economic power.</p>
<p class="indent">Large-scale population movements made matters worse. Displaced persons moved across Europe by the millions. The release of prisoners of war and slave workers imprisoned during the Third Reich strained already weak economies. Germans were expelled from territories that Germany had controlled before the war. Soviet expansionist policies forced others to flee Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Jews who survived the concentration camps resettled outside Europe, primarily in Palestine and the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">Industrial production in 1945 was one-third of its level in 1938. Housing shortages existed everywhere. France had lost one-fifth of its housing during the war years; Germany’s 50 largest cities had seen two-fifths of their buildings reduced to rubble. Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Dresden, Warsaw, and Berlin were virtually destroyed. The transportation infrastructure was severely damaged: railways, roads, and bridges were in shambles all over Europe. Communications networks were in disarray. In some cases, industrial plants had not been as adversely affected as urban centres. Yet machinery everywhere had been worn out in wartime production and replacement parts were non-existent. German equipment was dismantled and seized by Soviet soldiers to be used in Russia in place of what the Germans had destroyed.</p>
<p class="indent">Agriculture, too, suffered severe reversals in wartime economies and was unable to resume pre-war production in 1945. In general, European agriculture was producing at 50 per cent of its pre-war capacity. Livestock had been decimated during the war years &ndash; in France, for example, 50 per cent of all farm animals had been killed &ndash; and it was estimated that restoring herds would take decades. Italy suffered greatly, with one-third of its overall assets destroyed. The scarcity of goods converged with ballooning inflation. Black markets with astronomical prices for necessities flourished, while currency rates plummeted. Everywhere the outlook was bleak. Yet in less than a decade, the situation had been reversed. The solution came from outside of Europe.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Marshall Plan?</b></i></span> In contrast to the Soviet Union, the United States had incurred relatively light casualties in World War II. Since the fighting had not taken place on the North American continent, US cities, farmlands, and factories were intact. As the chief producer and supplier for the Allied war effort, even before its entry into the conflict, the United States had benefitted from the conflict in Europe and expanded its economic productivity during the war. In 1945, the United States was producing a full 50 per cent of the world’s gross national product &mdash; a staggering fact to a displaced Great Britain, whose former trade networks were permanently destroyed. Furthermore, the United States held two-thirds of the world’s gold. A United States bursting with energy and prosperity was a real threat to the Soviet Union viewing the rubble of its destroyed cities and counting the bodies of its dead.</p>
<p class="indent">The United States knew that it lacked one important guarantee to secure its growth and its future prosperity: adequate international markets for its goods. After World War I, American officials and businessmen understood that America’s productive capacity was outpacing its ability to export goods. In the 1920s, the United States had exported capital to Europe in the form of private loans with the hope that trade would flourish as a result. The decade following the Great Depression of 1929 witnessed the search for a policy to expand</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-505" class="calibre10"></a>U.S. markets. Both Europe and Japan were recognised as potential buyers for American goods, but both areas parried with protectionism to foster their own post-depression recovery.</p>
<p class="indent">World War II facilitated the success of an international economic policy consistent with international economic goals identified by US policymakers as early as 1920. In both Europe and Japan, the United States intervened to aid reconstruction and recovery of war-torn nations. These economies, hungry for capital, no longer opposed US intervention or erected trade barriers against American goods. The prospect of Europe in chaos economically, socially, and politically and on the verge of collapse justified immediate action by the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">By the spring of 1947, it was clear to American policymakers that initial post-war attempts to stabilise European economies and promote world recovery were simply not working. The United States had, earlier in the same year, engineered emergency aid to Turkey and Greece, both objects of Soviet aspirations for control. President Truman articulated a doctrine bearing his name. The aid emerged in an atmosphere of opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union over issues of territorial control in Eastern and Southern Europe. The Cold War coincided with and reinforced the US need to reconstruct Western Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">On 5 June 1947, Secretary of State, George C. Marshall (1880&ndash;1959) delivered the commencement address at Harvard University. In his speech, Marshall introduced the European Recovery Act, popularly known as the Marshall Plan, through which billions of dollars in aid would be made available to European states, both in the East and in the West, provided that two conditions were met: (1) the recipient states must cooperate with one another in aligning national economic policies and improving the international monetary system, and (2) they must work toward breaking down trade barriers.</p>
<p class="indent">Participating countries included Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey. Russia and Eastern European countries were also eligible for aid under the original formulation. Russia opposed the plan from the first, wary of US intentions to extend the influence of Western Capitalism. Soviet opposition encouraged members of the US Congress, afraid of a Communist takeover in Europe, to support the plan.</p>
<p class="indent">Like the United States, the Soviet Union had its own economic imperatives that dictated its attitudes toward European economic development. Under Stalin’s direction, the Soviet Union concentrated all its efforts on reconstructing its devastated economy and, to this end, sought integration with Eastern European states, whose technology and resources were needed for rebuilding of the Soviet state. US dominance threatened the vital connection with Eastern Europe that the Soviet Union was determinedly solidifying in the post-war years.</p>
<p class="indent">The amount of US aid to Europe was massive. Over $23 billion was pumped into Western Europe between 1947 and 1952. By every measure, the Marshall Plan was judged a success in the West. American foreign aid restored Western European trade and production, while at the same time controlling inflation. Dean Acheson (1893&ndash;1971), Marshall’s successor as secretary of state, described the plan in terms of ‘our duty as human beings’ but nevertheless considered it “chiefly as a matter of national self-interest’’. Soviet critics and western observers differed dramatically in describing the relationship between self-interest and philanthropy as motives for the plan.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-506" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was the Plan Administered?</b></i></span> As significant as the gift of funds to European states undoubtedly was, no less important was the whole administrative apparatus that the American money brought in its wake. In order to expend available monies most effectively and comply with stipulations for cooperation and regulation, the states of Western Europe resorted to intensified planning and limited nationalisation. These ideas were not new in the experience of European states: Vichy France, for example, had emphasised the importance of planning and specialisation in its corporatist approach to economic development and social-welfare policies. Regulation and state intervention dominated the formulation of economic policy. Special attention was given to workers’ welfare through unemployment insurance, retirement benefits, public health, and housing policies. European states recognized the need to provide a safety net for their citizens in order to avoid re-experiencing the disastrous depression and stagnation of the 1930s while attempting to rebuild their shattered economies. These were lessons that had been learned as much from the attempts at recovery before 1939 as from the experiences of running wartime economies.</p>
<p class="indent">The economic theory of John Maynard Keynes, applied successfully by neutral Sweden to its economic policies during the war, came into vogue throughout Europe in 1945, and the post-war era saw the triumph of Keynesian economics. Keynes favoured macro-economic policies to increase productivity and argued for an active role for government in ‘priming the pump’ of economic growth. The government should be responsible, according to Keynes, for the control and regulation of the economy with the goal of ensuring full employment for its people. Governments could and should check inflation and eliminate boom-and-bust cycles, incurring deficits by spending beyond revenues if necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">US foreign aid contributed mightily to the extension of central planning and the growth of the welfare state throughout Western Europe. Money alone could not have accomplished the recovery that took place. The chief mechanism for administering Marshall Plan aid was the Office of European Economic Cooperation (OEEC). This master coordinating agency made the requirements for recovery clear. European states had to stabilise their own economies. Cooperation between the public and private sectors was intended to free market forces, modernise production, and raise productivity. Planning mechanisms, including transnational organisations and networks, resulted in the modernisation of production and the assimilation of new techniques, new styles of management, and innovative business practices from the United States. This modernisation of economies through centrally coordinated planning made Europe once again a major contender in the international economic arena.</p>
<p class="indent">The exception to the establishment of central planning agencies and nationalisation of key industries was West Germany. Deciding against the British and French models of planned growth, the West Germans endorsed a free-market policy that encouraged private enterprise while providing state insurance for all workers. What has been described as ‘a free enterprise economy with a social conscience’ produced the richest economy in Western Europe by the mid-1950s. Some West German industries had been dismantled, but much of West Germany’s productive capacity remained intact in the late 1940s. The wealth of great industrialists, such as Krupp serving prison sentences as war criminals, had not been expropriated, and their commercial empires stood ready to direct the economic revival. The Krupp and I.G. Farben empires were successfully broken into smaller units. <a id="calibre_link-507" class="calibre10"></a>Industries forced to start afresh benefitted from the latest technology.</p>
<p class="indent">The United States had succeeded in exporting aspects of its own economy abroad. Through management and planning, recipients of American aid surpassed US goals. A multilateral system of world trade emerged out of the ashes of war. The effects of the Great Depression, which the world had been unable to shake throughout the 1930s, had been laid to rest by global war and its consequences.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Condition of Eastern Bloc</b></i></span>? The Soviet Union implemented an expansion of its territorial boundaries as a way of reversing some of its drastic losses in the war. Above all, it wanted a protective ring of satellite states as security from attack from the west. Stalin also was eager to see the Soviet Union surrounded by ‘friendly’ governments in Eastern Europe to replace the hostile regimes with which the Soviets had to contend in the period between the wars. Picking up territory from Finland, Poland, and parts of East Prussia and Eastern Czechoslovakia; forcibly reincorporating the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; and recovering Bessarabia, the Soviet Union succeeded in acquiring sizable territories. In addition, the Soviet state dedicated itself to economic reconstruction behind a protective buffer of satellite states &ndash; Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria &ndash; over which Soviet leaders exercised strong control. Yugoslavia and Albania chose to follow an independent Communist path. Lacking the capital necessary to finance recovery, the Soviets sought compensation from Eastern and Central European territories.</p>
<p class="indent">The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe participated in the general European recovery from World War II, but their recovery was slower, not nearly as spectacular as in Western Europe. The Soviet Union initially set the pattern of economic and political development, but over time the various nations within the Soviet sphere of dominance moved in their own directions. In the decades following the 1960s, economic problems appeared and persisted. Agricultural production became an almost yearly disappointment. High administrative costs, inflexibility to market demand, and lethargy in productivity plagued industry. The gap between the economies of Western and Eastern Europe seemed to be widening rather than narrowing. In recent years, these economic problems and the Soviet Union’s own efforts at political and economic reform have led to considerable unrest and demands for economic decentralisation in Eastern Europe. Ultimately, Soviet Union and Eastern Europe embarked on a series of major long-term reforms.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did Soviet Union Tackle the Problems?</b></i></span> Though the Soviet Union emerged victorious from World War II, the social and economic costs had been high. Few changes from pre-war policies were evident. Stalin continued to assert totalitarian rule with a tightly planned economy stressing heavy industrialisation. Political dissent was not allowed, and purges removed those perceived as potential threats. Prisons and forced-labour camps remained a feature of Stalin’s rule. Despite the heavy expenditures required to maintain the Red Army, the Soviet Union recovered.</p>
<p class="indent">The death of Stalin in 1953 led to a liberalisation of policies within the Soviet Union. Initially, Malenkov and Khrushchev struggled for power, but by 1955 Khrushchev had emerged as Stalin’s successor. The most dramatic indication of changes from the Stalin era came in a 1956 speech in which Khrushchev denounced the crimes of Stalin before startled Communist leaders in Moscow. Khrushchev removed many of the conservative Stalinists within the party hierarchy but avoided the use of harsh Stalinist purges. Controls over cultural life were slightly loosened, as evidenced by the publication of novels by Boris Pasternak. Economically, there was new stress on <a id="calibre_link-508" class="calibre10"></a>consumer goods and an attempt was made to reform agricultural policy. He embarked on an ambitious foreign policy. Khrushchev may have tried to do too much at once, for domestic and international difficulties began to undermine his position. The gravest problems occurred in foreign affairs. The Soviet Union became involved in a growing ideological dispute with the Chinese Communists, who were younger and more evangelical in the Marxist faith than the Russians. The split between the Soviet Union and China was intensified by boundary disputes. In 1962, Khrushchev blundered into a showdown with the United States by trying to set up Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba and was forced to make a humiliating retreat.</p>
<p class="indent">In October 1964, Khrushchev was suddenly ousted from power by his colleagues in the party’s Central Committee. Leonid Brezhnev replaced him as party secretary, eventually emerging as the actual head of government by the late 1960s. Brezhnev reversed some of the liberalisation of the Khrushchev years but did not fully return to Stalinist policies or practices. The Brezhnev era was marked by relative stability within the Soviet Union, a stability that seemed to persist under Andropov, his successor. The Soviet economy has continued to expand but unevenly and not as rapidly as expected &ndash; thanks to the drain of military and administrative expenditures. By the 1980s, the Soviet Union was a world leader in the production of steel, oil, coal, and cotton, and its industry was being computerised. Soviet agriculture was less successful. Although mechanisation constantly increased, periodic droughts, poor management, and lack of incentive forced the government to make repeated and expensive grain purchases from the United States and Canada. The standard of living rose, but it still trailed that of the West and even that of some of the satellite countries in Eastern Europe. Soviet citizens enjoyed free education and medical services and relative job security. The Soviet Union continued to assert itself internationally as a world power, as indicated by its involvement and intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968, Africa in the 1970s, Afghanistan in 1979, and Poland during the 1980s.</p>
<p class="indent">After Brezhnev died in 1982, Yuri Andropov (1982&ndash;84) and then Konstantin Chernenko (1984&ndash;85) came to power, but they did little to change the policies of the Brezhnev era. However, in 1985 the relatively young 54-year-old Mikhail Gorbachev rose to power and initiated a series of important reforms <i class="calibre8">(glasnost&mdash;</i>openness; <i class="calibre8">perestroika&mdash;</i>restructuring) in both foreign and domestic policy, including remodelling of the political system, attacks on corruption within the bureaucracy, decentralisation of economic policy, relaxation of controls over political and cultural dissent, and new efforts to relax international tensions and stimulate disarmament agreements. These reforms produced both resistance and change within the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Developments in Eastern Europe?</b></i></span> The governments and economies of Eastern Europe were brought under Stalin’s control and set up in imitation of the Soviet model during the late 1940s. Initially, the Soviet Union drained off economic resources from these countries to strengthen its own economy. Soon singleparty ‘people’s democracies’ were established in Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Albania. Each of these governments was dominated by the head of its Communist party, who usually ruled in Stalinist pattern. Each developed a planned economy stressing industrialisation and collectivisation of agriculture, and generally a high rate of economic growth was achieved. Each was required to cooperate politically, economically, and militarily with the Soviet Union. All major policies were tightly coordinated to the wishes of Moscow. Contact with the West was strictly limited. The one exception <a id="calibre_link-509" class="calibre10"></a>was Yugoslavia, wherein 1948 Tito managed to break from the rest of the Communist bloc and take an independent course. Tito initiated a more decentralised form of Communism stressing increased local control and worker participation in management.</p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, Eastern Europe should not be thought of as a mere appendage to the Soviet Union, even during the Stalinist period. Each state had its own sense of Nationalism, each had its own particular ethnic mix, and each had its own history. The Soviet Union had not found it easy to gain or maintain control.</p>
<p class="indent">The first stirrings of revolt from Soviet control followed Stalin’s death. In 1953 East Berliners rose but were quickly crushed by force. Following Khrushchev’s 1956 speech denouncing Stalin and some of his policies, Poland rose in revolt. A compromise that left Poland within the Soviet sphere of control avoided the use of Soviet troops in Poland. Poland would enjoy a mild liberalisation of its intellectual life and some economic independence. Shortly thereafter, a more violent armed revolt took place in Hungary. This more challenging demand for independence was met by an invasion of troops and the ouster of the new government. Nevertheless, under the Moscow-approved but moderate Janos Kadar, Hungarians were allowed increased individual freedom and greater national self-determination.</p>
<p class="indent">These revolts revealed some of the discontent and hopes for greater independence within East European nations, but the Soviet response also indicated the allowable limits to any deviance from the Soviet line. National differences between the various East European states and the Soviet Union were recognised. Contact with the West would be allowed. Cultural activities might be less restricted than in the Soviet Union. Fundamental political, economic, and military cooperation with Moscow was not to be violated.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the late 1950s, various Eastern European nations have pursued separate courses within the limits set by the Soviet Union. East Germany, Hungary, and Romania remained relatively tranquil during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. East Germany has closely followed the Soviet line while developing its industrial capacity. Hungary has successfully managed to orient its economy toward consumer goods, due to a loosening of state control and the introduction of limited capitalistic practices at the local level. In 1989, Hungary took new steps toward substantial democratic reform. Romania has taken a more politically independent and conservative course under the leadership of president Nicolae Ceausescu.</p>
<p class="indent">Albania, Czechoslovakia, and Poland have proven to be more of a problem to Moscow. In 1961 Albania, under Enver Hoxha, broke from Moscow and took the side of the Chinese in the Sino-Soviet split. Since Albania was surrounded by the already independent Yugoslavia and Greece, there was little the Soviet Union could do. In 1968, the Dubcek government in Czechoslovakia went too far in allowing intellectual freedom and some democratisation. The Soviet Union mobilised the troops of the Warsaw Pact nations and occupied Czechoslovakia. Dubcek and his supporters were removed from power along with their liberalising policies. In 1980, the Polish government began to have difficulty maintaining its control over the nation. Mainly protesting the continuing economic mismanagement and corruption within the government, Polish workers struck and organised a union, Solidarity, under the leadership of Lech Walesa. Solidarity became increasingly powerful and was succeeding in forcing the government to grant concessions. When the union seemed to go too far, pressure from Moscow and resistance from conservative elements in the Polish government stiffened. In December 1981, martial law was declared by the new leader of <a id="calibre_link-510" class="calibre10"></a>the Polish Communist party, General Wojciech Jaruzelski. After a series of governmental crackdowns, Solidarity was outlawed in October 1982. In 1983, martial law was lifted and the government, pressured in part by the Catholic Church, made some minor conciliatory gestures. Yet the fundamental political and economic problems that led to the unrest still keep Poland in a state of tension, as revealed by new strikes, a renewal of Solidarity’s activities in 1988, new agreements between Solidarity and the government, and elections in 1989 giving Solidarity even greater power.</p>
<p class="indent">When compared with the economies of nations in Western Europe, the economies of Eastern Europe seem deficient. This deficiency is particularly apparent in recent years as the gap between Western and Eastern Europe seems to have widened. In the late 1980s, Eastern Europe has been marked by growing discontent, greater political instability, and new demands for decentralisation of economic decision making (as in Western capitalistic countries). On the other hand the economies of Eastern Europe started from a lower base and had to overcome greater difficulties. Overall, these economies have been modernising, and Eastern Europeans have been enjoying a rising standard of living. Basic social services are extensive. With the exception of the elite of the Communist party and certain professionals, the gap between rich and poor classes has been narrowed. The Eastern European nations, while still under the shadow of the Soviet Union, are distinct states with their own pasts and futures.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-67"><b class="calibre9">EMERGENCE OF THIRD WORLD</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Meaning?</b></i></span> The term ‘Third World’ refers to the economically backward countries of Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Latin America, regarded as a group with common features, such as poverty, high birth-rates, and economic dependence on the developed countries. The French demographer Alfred Sauvy invented the phrase (<i class="calibre8">tiers monde</i> in French) in 1952 in likeness to the ‘third estate.’ It refers to the commoners of France before and during the French Revolution, in contrast to priests and nobles, consisting of the first and second estates respectively. Just like the third estate, arued Sauvy, the Third World is nothing, and it “wants to be something.” The term, therefore, means that the Third World is exploited in ways similar to the exploitation of the third estate, and that, like the third estate its destiny is a revolutionary one. It also implies a second idea, also pointed out by Sauvy, that of non-alignment, for the Third World does not belong either to the industrialised capitalist world or to the industrialised Communist group.</p>
<p class="indent">The term, Third World, was applied at the 1955 Conference of Afro-Asian countries held in Bandung, Indonesia. In 1956, some social scientists connected to Sauvy’s National Institute of Demographic Studies, in Paris, published a book called <i class="calibre8">Le Tiers-Monde</i>. After three years, the French economist Francois Perroux started a new journal with the same title to deal with problems of underdevelopment. Towards close of the 1950s, the phrase was commonly used in the French media to refer to the underdeveloped countries of Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Latin America.</p>
<p class="indent">The First World refers to the developed world &ndash; US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, etc. The Second World meant the Communist world led by the USSR. With the fall of the USSR and the Communist bloc, Second World no longer exists. The Third World means the underdeveloped world &ndash; agrarian, rural and poor. Third World countries usually have one or two flourishing cities, but the remaining part of the country is poor, rural and agrarian. Presently Eastern Europe would be treated as part of Third World. Russia should similarly be treated a Third World country albeit with <a id="calibre_link-511" class="calibre10"></a>nuclear weapons. China, has always been regarded Third World, and continues to be so. Normally, Latin America, Africa, and most of Asia are still treated as Third World. The Asian tigers of South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and, Thailand (despite their big cities, their production facilities, a small middle class and a much smaller ruling elite) should also be counted as Third World countries, because their populations are overwhelmingly rural, agrarian and poor.</p>
<p class="indent">Some poor African countries have no industrialisation, are predominantly agrarian (subsistence farming), and have no chance of industrialising and competing in the world ‘marketplace’. These are occasionally termed the ‘Fourth World’. The expression ‘Third World’ is not unanimously accepted. Some favour other terms like the South, non-industrialised countries, underdeveloped countries, undeveloped countries, mal-developed countries, emerging nations. The phrase ‘Third World’ is undoubtedly the most commonly used in the media today. There is no other term to describe all non-”First World”, non-industri-alised, non-developed, non-Western countries more accurately.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What are its Problems?</b></i></span> The underdevelopment of the Third World is manifested by a number of common features: distorted economies dedicated to producing primary products for the developed world and to offer markets for their finished goods; conventional, rural social structures; high population growth; and pervasive poverty. Nonetheless, Third World is hugely disparate, because it comprised <a id="calibre_link-512" class="calibre10"></a>countries at various levels of economic development. In spite of the poverty of the rural areas and the urban slums, the ruling elites of most Third World countries are affluent.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00041.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Emergence of Third World</p>
<p class="indent">This mixture of situations across Asia, Africa, Oceania and Latin America is connected to the incorporation of the Third World into the global capitalist economy, by way of conquest or indirect domination. The chief economic result of western domination was the first ever creation of a world market. By establishing all over the Third World sub-economies connected to the West, and by inaugurating other modern institutions, Industrial Capitalism disrupted not only traditional economies but also societies. This disruption led to underdevelopment.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the economies of underdeveloped countries have been oriented towards the needs of industrialised countries, they mostly include limited modern economic activities, such as mining or cultivation of plantation crops. Management of these activities has continued to be in the hands of large foreign firms. The prices of Third World products are generally fixed by large buyers in the Western countries, and trade with the West accounts for almost all the Third World’s income. Throughout the colonial period, blatant exploitation severely restricted the accumulation of capital within the foreigndominated countries. Even after decolonisation in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the Third World economies grew slowly, or not at all, mainly due to the deterioration of the “terms of trade”. This term refers to the relation between the cost of goods that a nation import and its income from the exports to foreign countries. Because buyers in the industrialised countries fixed the prices of almost all goods involved in international trade, the deteriorating condition of the Third World was hardly surprising. Only the oil-producing countries (after 1973) managed to avoid the effects of Western domination of the world economy.</p>
<p class="indent">No research on the Third World could hope to measure its future prospects without considering population growth. In 1980, the earth’s population stood at 4.4 billion, with the Third World accounting for 72 per cent of it. And by the end of the century it was expected to reach 6.2 billion, with 80 per cent in the Third World. This projected population explosion in the Third World is likely to prevent any major improvements in living standards there as well as pose threat of worsening poverty in stagnant economies.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What are its Prospects?</b></i></span> The Bandung Conference in 1955 was the commencement of the political appearance of the Third World. Two nations with diametrically opposite social and economic systems&ndash; China and India &ndash; played a major role in promoting that conference and in altering the relation between the Third World and the industrial countries, Capitalist as well as Communist. Due to decolonisation, the United Nations that was initially numerically dominated by European countries and countries of European origin, was steadily changed into almost a Third World forum. Consequently, the issue of underdevelopment soon became the focus of an unending, but essentially academic, debate. Despite that debate, the unity of the Third World continues to be theoretical, expressed mainly from the platforms of international conferences.</p>
<p class="indent">Foreign aid as well as every effort of existing institutions and structures have not been successful in solving the problem of underdevelopment. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) held in New Delhi in 1971 proposed that one per cent of the national income of industrialised countries should be allotted to aiding the Third World. That figure has never been realised, or even approximated. In 1972 the Santiago (Chile) UNCTAD fixed a target of a six per cent economic growth rate in the 1970s for the underdeveloped countries. This, too, was never accomplished. The unenviable living conditions of the overwhelming majority of <a id="calibre_link-513" class="calibre10"></a>the three billion people belonging to the poor countries have neither changed since 1972 nor deteriorated much.</p>
<p class="indent">The economic development that has taken place in the Third World has not been distributed justly either between nations or among classes within nations. Majority of the Third World countries that have succeeded in achieving considerable economic growth are those that produce oil: mostly Arab countries, Iran, Gabon, and Venezuela. They became prosperous because after 1973 the Organization of Oil producing Countries (OPEC), a cartel, decided to increase the price of oil drastically. Other important raw materials are also produced by underdeveloped countries, which have similarly established cartels like OPEC. For example, Australia, Guinea, Guyana, Jamaica, Sierra Leone, Suriname, and Yugoslavia established the Bauxite International Association (BIA) in 1974; and Chile, Peru, Zaire, and Zambia set up a cartel of copper producing countries in 1967. Even strategic raw materials like copper and bauxite are not as crucial to the industrialised countries as oil, and these cartels thus lack OPEC’s power. Further, the countries that produce food items like cocoa, coffee and other foods are practically helpless to impose their will. In fact, among the non-OPEC countries, only Brazil, the Ivory Coast, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan have enjoyed noteworthy economic growth. Since the underdeveloped nations are jointly so weak, the so-called ‘new economic order’ advocated by some of them may only remain a phrase.</p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, the relationship between the underdeveloped and the industrialised countries has become better. In 1975, the European Economic Community (EEC) signed an agreement, called the Lome Pact, with 46 African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) nations that exempted most ACP exports from tariffs. The Lome II Pact, concluded in 1979 by the EEC and 57 ACP countries, elaborated the Lome I treaty, for instance, by guaranteeing income from agricultural exports.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet, other than a few oil-producing countries with low populations, the economic crisis of the 1970s was more harmful to the Third World than to the West. Moreover, in the near future apparently there is not much scope for any major change in the relationship between the industrialised and underdeveloped countries. Unfortunately, the prospects for economic development in the Third World seem to be very bleak: between 1960 and 1980 half of the African countries had actually become poorer. The only countries to get some of the capital needed for development were those fortunate enough to have a significant amount of raw materials, especially oil, to export.</p>
<p class="indent">Every international agency feels that drastic action is needed to improve conditions in Third World countries. These consist of urban and rural public work projects to tackle joblessness and underemployment, institutional reforms crucial for the redistribution of economic power, agrarian reform, tax reform, and the reform of public funding. In truth, political and social hurdles to reform are integral to the international order and most Third World regimes.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-68"><b class="calibre9">UNO AND GLOBAL DISPUTES</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why and how was UNO Born?</b></i></span> The birth of the United Nations represents the culmination of a prolonged quest for international peace and cooperation. The Concert of Europe during the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century was a step in that direction. The League of Nations, as part of the peace settlement of 1919, was the first permanent and universal organisation of its kind. However, it fell victim to the forces of aggressive Nationalism and Militarism.</p>
<p class="indent">It was on the ruins of the League system that a new and better equipped organisation was to emerge. This is traceable to the Atlantic Charter (August 14, 1941), jointly signed by Churchill and Roosevelt. The charter stated <a id="calibre_link-514" class="calibre10"></a>that every nation of the world, for realistic and ideological reasons, must abandon the use of force. Moreover, “since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten or may threaten aggression outside their frontiers,” they, the signatories, believe, “pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential”. The Atlantic Charter anticipated a stable international organisation and a more effective system of collective security than that stipulated by the League of Nations.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, the Moscow Conference of the Allies led to the promulgation of a Declaration (October 30, 1943). The Teheran Declaration (December 1, 1943) entrusted to the Allies the task initiating ‘a world family of democratic nations’. The Dumberton Oaks Conference (1944) prepared proposals for the establishment of a general international organisation. Finally, the San Francisco Conference, sponsored by Britain, the USA and the USSR, met on Apri1 25, 1945. While the Allies were virtually committed to the defence of ‘a common set of proposals and anxious to avoid reopening of old wounds’, the smaller countries did not like the excessive domination of UN by the great powers. In particular, they took exception to the principle of veto. Ultimately compromised conclusions were agreed upon. The Dumberton Oaks structure remained virtually intact, though some important changes were introduced. Finally, the Charter came into effect on October 24, 1945.</p>
<p class="indent">The states participating at the San Francisco Conference and eventually becoming original members of the UN numbered 51. Article 4 of the UN Charter states that membership is to be conferred upon peace-loving and law-abiding nations. The General Assembly can, on the recommendations of the Security Council, admit a state to membership. The principal organs of the UN, as stipulated under Article 7, are the General Assembly, Security Council and others.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did the General Assembly Function?</b></i></span> It elects its president annually and meets at least once a year on the initiative of either the UN Secretary-General or the majority of the member states. The proceedings of the General Assembly can be divided into four categories: (a) formulation of international public opinion, (b) pacific settlement of international disputes, (c) discussion and clarification of international law and basic human rights, and (d) transfer of issues from the Security Council to the General Assembly.</p>
<p class="indent">It consists of all members of the United Nations, each state having not more than five representatives and a single vote. In this body, there is no difference at all between a big power and a small power; all members have the right to equal representation, equal opportunity to participate in discussions, and equal voting power. Decision on substantive matters are taken by simple majority of two-third votes, depending upon the importance of the question. There is no veto, which is a special privilege of the permanent members of the Security Council in that council only.</p>
<p class="indent">The Assembly is an advisory and recommendatory body; its resolutions have no binding effect. Its jurisdiction covers a very wide range of matters &ndash; ‘any question or any matter within the scope of the present charter or relating to the powers and functions of any organ provided for in the present charter’. More specifically, the Assembly can consider the general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security as well as specific questions relating to the maintenance of peace and security. It can deal with a wide range of matters in the field of economic, social and cultural cooperation. It can also look into the administration of territories which are not self-governed, with human rights and self-determination. It <a id="calibre_link-515" class="calibre10"></a>has authority in respect of the composition of the United Nations bodies. It can admit new members to the United Nations on the recommendation of the Security Council. It can elect non-permanent members of the Security Council. It can join the Security Council in electing judges to the International Court of Justice. There is one serious restriction on the functions of the General Assembly: It cannot deal with any matter which is already placed before the Security Council unless requested by the body.</p>
<p class="indent">The role which the General Assembly has actually been playing in international affairs cannot be assessed properly on the basis of the functions assigned to it in the charter. Since 1948, the General Assembly has largely replaced the Security Council as the chief UN organ to deal with political questions. The total number of political and security questions dealt with by the General Assembly between the years 1946 and 1961 was 206, as against 57 dealt with by the Security Council.</p>
<p class="indent">The process of expansion of the General Assembly’s jurisdiction was accelerated by the ‘uniting for peace’ resolution adopted by the Assembly in 1950 in connection with the Korean War. “If the Security Council” said the resolution, “was prevented from acting in an emergency, the Assembly could meet on short notice and recommend appropriate collective measures for maintenance or restoration of peace, including the use of armed force, if necessary.” Strictly speaking, this was an encroachment upon the functions of the Security Council, and it is doubtful whether the resolution is legally consistent with the provisions of the charter. It was the political response of the Assembly, which was then dominated by the United States, to the situation created by the Soviet Union’s use of the veto. As the Security Council was immobilised, the General Assembly took upon itself the responsibility of taking action in the interest of international peace.</p>
<p class="indent">The United States favoured enlargement of the Assembly’s functions for two reasons. It could count upon a substantial majority in the Assembly, and the Soviet Union would normally be in a minority. Secondly, the Soviet Union could not reduce the Assembly to immobility because it had no veto there. For these reasons, the Soviet Union opposed the ‘uniting for peace’ resolution.</p>
<p class="indent">In recent years, the United States has lost its advantageous position in the Assembly as a result of large increase in the number of Afro-Asian members who generally support the Soviet Union particularly on issues connected with Imperialism and Colonialism. The Assembly is now a much larger body than it was in earlier. Technically speaking, the decisions of the UN have no binding force, but they are morally and politically important.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is the Role of Security Council?</b></i></span> The Articles 23 and 32 relate to the Security Council. The charter provided that the Security Council would consist of eleven members of the United Nations &ndash; five permanent members (China, France, the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States) and six non-permanent members, elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms, without eligibility for immediate re-election. By an amendment of the charter, which became effective on and from August 31, 1965, the number of non-permanent members was raised to.</p>
<p class="indent">There was no Communist China when the UN was born. Subsequently in 1949, the entire mainland of China came under the Communist government, and the previous Kuomintang government shifted to the island of Formosa (Taiwan). The permanent seat in the Security Council assigned to China was occupied by the Kuomintang government, and the Communist government had no place in the United Nations. The anomalous arrangement has now been changed, and the permanent seat <a id="calibre_link-516" class="calibre10"></a>assigned to China has been occupied by the Peking government.</p>
<p class="indent">Each member of the Security Council has one vote, but these votes do not have equal weight as in the General Assembly. In ‘procedural matters’, decisions are made, according to the provisions of the charter, by seven ‘affirmative’ votes. (This number has been raised to nine by the amendment.) Decisions on non-procedural or substantive matters are made, according to the provisions of the charter, by seven ‘affirmative’ votes ‘including the concurring vote of the permanent members’ (here also the number would be nine in terms of the amendment). In other words, no decision can be made on a substantive matter unless all permanent members agree, since anyone of the permanent members can veto a decision favoured by a majority, or even by all other members.</p>
<p class="indent">The big powers who established the United Nations provide for themselves two special privileges intended to safeguard their position and interests: (1) a permanent seat in the Security Council and (2) the power of veto.</p>
<p class="indent">The Security Council is the principal executive organ of the United Nations. Its primary responsibility is the maintenance of international peace and security. In discharging the responsibility it may call upon disputing parties to seek a solution by negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice. Against a recalcitrant party to a dispute it may call upon the members of the United Nations to apply ‘sanctions’ or coercive measures such as ‘complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations’. In extreme cases the Security Council itself may ‘take such action by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary’ using the’ armed forces, assistance and facilities’ provided by UN members as per the terms of the charter. The powers vested in the Security Council are larger than those enjoyed by the Council of the League of Nations. Article 39 stipulates that the Security Council must enquire into the alleged breach of peace before punitive measures are undertaken.</p>
<p class="indent">The role which the Security Council has been playing in international affairs cannot be assessed properly on the basis of the functions assigned to it in the charter. It has in practice failed to play the expected role of the central executive organ of the United Nations. The ‘eclipse of the Security Council’ is attributed primarily to the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. “That conflict,” says Morgenthau, “has paralysed the Security Council as an agency of international government.” In the few instances when it has been able to do so, as in the beginning of the Korean War, by accidental and temporary absence of the USSR. It is true that Soviet Union has used the veto too frequently. Of the 99 vetoes cast till 1961, Moscow was responsible for 92. But more than fifty per cent of the Soviet vetoes were cast on membership applications.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How does the UN Compare with the League?</b></i></span> In general, the authors of the UN profited from the limitations and mistakes of the League of Nations. The experience of the League was utilised at different stages. This explains the continuity between the League and the UN. After all, like the League, the UN is a voluntary association of states for fostering international cooperation on political and non-political lines. The UN is equipped with virtually the same organisational network, including an assembly, council, court, secretariat, economic and social bodies and trusteeship committee. The delegations of member states are equal in size with one vote apiece. The UN, like its precursor, in most cases is empowered only to recommended and not command.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-517" class="calibre10"></a>Yet there are some important differences between the provisions of the covenant and the charter in admission of new members, voting, withdrawal of members, suspension of members’ privileges, preservation of collective security, treatment of economic and social issues, etc. Particularly important is the great authority enjoyed by the UN with regard to the maintenance of collective security. Articles 10, 11 and 16 of the League covenant dealing with war and peace were somewhat incomplete and defective. Article 1 of the UN charter recommends ‘effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace’. The charter then proceeds to indicate the nature of ‘effective collective measures’ in Chapter 8. The sanctional articles of the charter are much stronger than those of the covenant.</p>
<p class="indent">The objectives of the charter are far more extensive than those of the covenant. By 1945, the idea of international cooperation had progressed substantially. The League Covenant was drafted as an organic constituent of the post-war peace settlement. This had many nations suspect the functions of the League. The drafting of the UN charter had nothing to do with any peace treaty. The League was basically an organisation of European powers, with the USA never a member and with different powers remaining outside the League at different stages. The UN may be called a truly global organisation, with non-European countries far outnumbering the countries of Europe and playing a vital role. Despite inadequacies, UN represents an advancement in respect of international peace and cooperation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What are its Failures?</b></i></span> It is generally agreed that the record of the United Nations fall short of the hopes and expectations of those who drafted the charter in 1945. While there is no satisfactory method of statistically measuring the extent of this shortcoming, most observers would agree that the gap is considerable.</p>
<p class="indent">Strictly speaking, the United Nations has not succeeded in settling in a definite way a single dispute dealt by the Security Council or by the General Assembly or by both. Final settlement of international disputes is rare; to prevent a crisis by postponement or compromise is often the best practical method of dealing with a threat to peace. Moreover, the charter does not require the United Nations to take direct responsibility for the solution of all disputes brought before it. The Security Council may leave any matter to be decided by the parties concerned, insisting only upon peaceful methods such as negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements or other peaceful methods of their own choice. It should also be noted that mediators appointed by the United Nations have done useful work in connection with some international disputes, for example, the Indonesian and the Arab&ndash;Jewish issues.</p>
<p class="indent">One basic difference between the League system and the UN system lay in the degree of efficiency of ‘sanctions’. The enforcement provisions in the charter were stronger than those in the covenant. As scholars point out, ‘The planned-for “teeth” have failed to grow.’ Elaborate plans for security and enforcement have been prepared by the military staff committee, the Commission for Conventional Armaments, the Atomic Energy Committee, etc., but the rivalry of the Powers has stood in the way of their implementation. The result has been that members of the United Nations have turned to the right of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the charter for providing greater assurance of their national security.</p>
<p class="indent">The charter emphasises the importance of agreement upon ‘the least diversion for armaments of the world’s human and economic resources’. The United Nations has not been able to achieve the regulation of national armament: Here again the root cause is the <a id="calibre_link-518" class="calibre10"></a>rivalry of the Powers. Less use has been made of the International Court of Justice for the settlement of legal disputes than what was made of the Permanent Court of International Justice during a comparable period.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What are its Achievements?</b></i></span> While the list of failures is formidable, the list of achievements is far less impressive. The achievements of the United Nations lie primarily outside the sphere of international peace and security.</p>
<p class="indent">First, it has been very active in the field of human rights. One of its major achievements has been the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On 10 December 1948, the General Assembly proclaimed a declaration as ‘a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations’. The declaration consists of a Preamble and 30 articles. Articles 1 and 2 talk of free birth of all human beings and equality of all in dignity and rights. Everyone is entitled to all rights and freedom put down in the declaration. The declaration further states non-distinction between race, colour, sex, language, and religion. Nor will national or social origin, birth or property be counted for or against any individual.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1982, feeling an increasing danger of military intervention in Central America by the American armed forces, Nicaragua asked for a meeting of the Security Council. The US government, in its turn, accused the Nicaraguan government of interfering in the affairs of the neighbouring states and of a conduct designed to destabilise the region.</p>
<p class="indent">The Central American nations got together to sign a comprehensive draft agreement called the ‘Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America’. The Security Council met in May on 1983 and agreed unanimously on the right of all Central American nations to live in El Salvador and Honduras and the increasing number of refugees in that region. It requested the United States to respect the Contadora Act. In 1987, the Secretary-General of the United</p>
<p class="noindent">Nations and his counterpart of the Organisation of American States visited the Central American countries to organise peace and to accelerate the negotiating process. Under the five-nation peace plan (August 1987), it was decided not to grant sanctuary to rebel groups for attack on neighbours. The rebels continued to trouble the government in Nicaragua with the support from the USA. Under an accord reached in August 1989 it was agreed to disband the rebels and hold fair elections in 1990.</p>
<p class="indent">When Congo, now Zaire, got its independence from Belgium in 1960, the nation was in a bad shape. Civil war was imminent at the attempted secession of the province of Katanga. The Congolese government asked for military assistance and within 48 hours, the United Nations force provided by the Asian and African members reached Congo. In the next four years that it stayed there, its chief task was to help the nation restore peace and maintain its political independence. It also helped Congo in maintaining law and order, and took up a long-term programme of training and technical assistance. In February 1963, after having reinstated Katanga, the UN forces began to move out. Even after its departure, civilian aid continued in Congo till 1967 when Katanga was officially brought back into Congo.</p>
<p class="indent">The Security Council met in 1979 at the request of Democratic Kampuchea who accused Vietnam of aggression. At first due to a veto by one of the council’s permanent members, the draft resolution &ndash; demanding strict adherence to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States and calling on all foreign forces to observe a cease-fire, end hostilities and withdraw from Kampuchea &ndash; was not adopted. However, at the request of several Asian nations, the General Assembly took up the issue. The draft resolution now became a plea from the Assembly’s side and it asked all nations and humanitarian and charitable organisations to render all kinds of <a id="calibre_link-519" class="calibre10"></a>relief and help to the war-torn Kampuchea. The United Nations Border Relief Operation (UNBRO) looked after more than 2.5 lakhs of people in the evacuation sites. It had tried to preserve a civilian atmosphere in the campsites and consolidate relief operations, improve health, nutrition and social welfare.</p>
<p class="indent">The basic cause of the failure of the United Nations to fulfill the high hopes of its promoters is the conflict between the two superpowers. Morgenthau says, “The conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union has prevented the United Nations from becoming the international government of the great powers which the charter intended it to be.” Another writer says that the roots of the failure of the United Nations, “lie deeply embedded in nationalism, sovereignty, and nation-state psychology, and also in the perversities of the human race”. The persistent strength of Nationalism is certainly one of the major factors in the failure of the UN. Being an organisation of sovereign states, the UN has to respect rights and sentiments; it has no independent authority to pass laws and to enforce its will by force.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-71"><b class="calibre9">LATIN AMERICA: BOLIVAR</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Liberation from mother country, namely, Spain, came abruptly for most of Latin America. Between 1810 and 1825, majority of Spain’s previous colonies had fought for and gained freedom, but got divided into several republics. Emotions had been rising in the colonies for some time, particularly from the time of the American Revolution. Although Spanish forces efficiently quashed most early rebellions, the idea of independence had taken root in the minds of the people of Latin America and continued to grow.</p>
<p class="indent">Napoleon’s invasion of Spain (1807&ndash;1808) provided the spark the rebels needed. Napoleon, seeking to expand his empire, attacked and defeated Spain, and he put his elder brother Joseph on the Spanish throne. This act made for a perfect pretext for secession, and when Spain had thrown off Joseph in 1813, majority of their former colonies had declared themselves independent. Spain fought valiantly to hold on to its rich colonies. Although the independence movements took place at about the same time, the regions were not united and each area had its own leaders and history.</p>
<p class="indent">The independence struggle in Northern Latin America began in 1806, when Venezuelan Francisco <i class="calibre8">de</i> Miranda first attempted to liberate his homeland with British help. Spanish resistance was fierce, however, and rebel and Spanish forces battled in the area until 1812, when Miranda was handed over to Spanish authorities and jailed.</p>
<p class="indent">At this point, a young officer named Simon Bolivar took over the struggle for <a id="calibre_link-524" class="calibre10"></a>independence. Bolivar fought the Spanish in Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia for several years, decisively beating them several times. By 1822, those countries were free, and Bolivar set his sights on Peru, the last and mightiest Spanish holdout on the continent.</p>
<p class="indent">Along with his close friend and subordinate Antonio Jose <i class="calibre8">de</i> Sucre, Bolivar won two important victories in 1824: at Junin, on August 6, and at Ayacucho on December 9. Their forces routed, the Spanish signed a peace agreement shortly after the battle of Ayacucho.</p>
<p class="indent">Argentina drew up its own government on May 25, 1810, in response to Napoleon’s capture of Spain, although it would not formally declare independence until 1816. Though rebel Argentine forces fought several small battles with Spanish forces, most of their efforts went towards fighting larger Spanish garrisons in Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p class="indent">The fight for Argentine Independence was led by Jose <i class="calibre8">de</i> San Martin, an Argentine native who had been trained as a military officer in Spain. In 1817, he crossed the Andes into Chile, where Bernardo O’Higgins and his rebel army had been fighting the Spanish to a draw since 1810. Joining forces, the Chileans and Argentines soundly defeated the Spanish at the Battle of Maipu (near Santiago, Chile) on April 5, 1818; effectively ending Spanish control over the Southern part of South America.</p>
<p class="indent">Independence in Mexico was sparked by father Miguel Hidalgo, a priest living and working in the small town of Dolores. He and a small group of conspirators started the rebellion by ringing the church bells on the morning of September 16, 1810. His ragtag army made it partway to the capital before being driven back, and Hidalgo himself was captured and executed in July 1811.With its leader’s removal, the Mexican freedom struggle practically failed, but leadership was taken over by Jose Maria Morelos, another priest and a gifted general.</p>
<p class="noindent">Morelos scored continuous extraordinary victories over Spanish forces, but was finally captured and executed in December, 1815.</p>
<p class="indent">The rebellion continued, and two new leaders came to prominence: Vicente Guerrero and Guadalupe Victoria, both of whom commanded large armies in the South and South-Central parts of Mexico. The Spanish sent out a young officer, Agustin <i class="calibre8">de</i> Iturbide, at the head of a large army to quash the rebellion once and for all in 1820. Iturbide, however, was distressed over political developments in Spain and switched sides. With the defection of its largest army, Spanish rule in Mexico was essentially over, and Spain formally recognised Mexico’s independence on August 24, 1821.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Spain lost all of their colonies on the mainland by 1825, it retained control over Cuba and Puerto Rico. It had already lost control of Hispaniola due to slave uprisings in Haiti. In Cuba, Spanish forces put down several major rebellions, including one which lasted from 1868 to 1878. It was led by Carlos Manuel <i class="calibre8">de</i> Cespedes. Another major attempt at independence took place in 1895, when ragtag forces including poet and Cuban patriot Jose Marti were defeated at the Battle of Dos Rios. The revolution was still simmering in 1898 when the United States and Spain fought the Spanish-American War. After the war, Cuba became a US protectorate and was granted independence in 1902.</p>
<p class="indent">In Puerto Rico, nationalist forces staged occasional uprisings, including a notable one in 1868. None were successful, however, and Puerto Rico did not become independent from Spain until 1898 as a result of the Spanish-American War. The island became a US protectorate, and has been so ever since.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was Latin American Independence?</b></i></span> Latin American Independence (1807&ndash;1824) was the political and military movement that ended colonial rule by Spain and Portugal over <a id="calibre_link-525" class="calibre10"></a>Mexico, Central America, and South America and gave birth to the modern independent nations of Latin America. At the beginning of the independence movement in the early 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, Latin America had two huge and fruitful colonial empires; the Spanish and the Portuguese. Spain’s colonies extended from the present-day Western United States and Mexico to Argentina, whereas Portugal’s empire comprised Brazil.</p>
<p class="indent">People of the colonies were inspired by the new Enlightenment ideas of Europe. They rejected traditional beliefs and authority and advocated new concepts like restricting the power of monarchs. The late 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century American and French Revolutions together gave inspiration for several Spanish-American and Brazilian colonists to attain greater control over their economic and political matters.</p>
<p class="indent">In this scenario, dramatic events of Spain and Portugal ignited the independence movements, starting from 1807. Warfare with France caused Spain to loosen control over its American colonies, which led to a degree of colonial self-government. The war forced the Portuguese royal court to flee to Brazil, which became for a time the centre of that empire. By 1824, both of the great empires had collapsed.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the Spanish colonies and Brazil won their independence, however, they found themselves ill-prepared to function effectively. Their economies were not diversified, their roads and ports were not developed, and their people lacked experience at representative government because of the colonial, system. Leaders were divided over the roles that government and the Church should play in the new nations. Within many countries, regions fought with each other for political or economic power. The independent nations created somewhat more open societies than the colonial regimes they replaced, introducing republican institutions, gradually ending slavery, and allowing improvement in the status of non-whites. Many of the countries came under the control of military dictators, setting a pattern that continued into the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why Did it Take Place?</b></i></span> There were many reasons as to why the independence movements arose in Latin America. Under the system of Colonialism, these territories were subject to extensive and complex networks of control by Spain and Portugal. Both empires functioned fairly well for three centuries. By the mid-1700s, grievances developed among the colonists, who complained about economic restrictions and tax burdens imposed by the imperial powers. Those born in the colonies also resented the fact that European-born residents were favoured for important bureaucratic and administrative positions.</p>
<p class="indent">The frustration of the Spanish-Americans was fueled by the intellectual movement of the Enlightenment. With its emphasis on science and reason, the Enlightenment challenged political and social institutions such as monarchy, religion, mercantilism, and class distinctions. Many Creoles read the works of the leading Enlightenment writers, and many future leaders of the Spanish-American independence movements spent time in Europe as students, soldiers, or on business.</p>
<p class="indent">The American Revolution (1775&ndash;1783) and the French Revolution (1789&ndash;1799) provided an example for the Spanish American colonists. Some Creoles fought in those revolutions, which were grounded in the ideas of the Enlightenment and saw colonists cast off monarchs to form independent, republican governments. However, many Spanish Americans were also frightened by the social upheaval that followed the French Revolution, including the bloody war for independence in the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue, which became the nation of Haiti.</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time that colonists were becoming dissatisfied with imperial rule, Spain began to face problems at home. During the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> and 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> <a id="calibre_link-526" class="calibre10"></a>centuries, Spain became involved in a number of international wars, which seriously strained the kingdom’s finances. During the early years of the Napoleonic Wars (1799&ndash;1815), Spain was pressured by French emperor Napoleon I to join France in a war against Britain. To isolate Britain from the European continent, Napoleon sent an army across Spain in 1807 to attack Portugal, a British ally. The French forced the Portuguese royal court to flee Lisbon for Brazil and cut off British access to Portugal’s ports. This changed the course of history for Brazil, making it the centre of the Portuguese empire and postponing its independence for a decade and a half.</p>
<p class="indent">After conquering Portugal, Napoleon turned on his Spanish allies and occupied a portion of Northern Spain. King Charles IV was abdicated in 1808 and his son, Ferdinand VII took the throne. Napoleon deposed Ferdinand and made his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, king instead. This caused Spaniards to rise in rebellion against the French on May 2, 1808, in a war of independence. Refusing to recognise Bonaparte as the king, councils (called <i class="calibre8">juntas</i>) formed in cities around Spain to fight the French and govern in the name of King Ferdinand. These councils soon joined and formed a central <i class="calibre8">junta</i>, later replaced by a Council of Regency. Despite the British sending an army to help the Spanish, the French controlled most of the country by 1809.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What Was its Nature?</b></i></span> The turmoil in Spain created confusion within its American colonies, since Spain could no longer exert control over its distant empire. Just as in Spain, <i class="calibre8">juntas</i> rose in the colonies, refusing to recognise Bonaparte and proclaiming their loyalty to the deposed king. Some colonists viewed this as a temporary measure until the monarchy was restored, but others saw the crisis as an opportunity to take more control of their own affairs, or even to overthrow the viceroyalties and declare independence from Spain. Rebellions with varying goals occurred almost simultaneously in 1810 in Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, and Chile. From 1810 to 1814, the absence of control from Spain gave many Creoles their first taste of self-government.</p>
<p class="indent">When Ferdinand was restored to the Spanish throne in 1814, he attempted to reinstate absolute royal control over the empire, rejecting liberal reforms approved in 1812 by Spain’s interim parliament. By then, many colonies had become dangerously comfortable governing themselves and were unwilling to return to their subordinate status. In each colony, Spanish Americans divided into factions: the so-called patriots, who sought independence, and royalists, who supported Spanish rule. Spanish America’s future would be decided in a series of military campaigns between these groups over the next decade.</p>
<p class="indent">The independence movement in Spanish America was primarily an effort by the white elite of the colonies to achieve self-government for their class. Some leaders advocated abolition of slavery or other social changes, but these were not central issues. Mestizos, Native Americans, and people of colour, slave and free, fought on both sides in the conflict.</p>
<p class="indent">While the Napoleonic Wars precipitated the movement for independence in Spain’s American colonies, they delayed its outbreak in the Portuguese colony of Brazil. Portugal’s royal family, having fled Europe after Napoleon’s invasion, ruled from Brazil until 1820. Although some revolts against royal authority occurred, independence eventually came to Brazil in 1822 without bloodshed and with the support of the governing Portuguese prince.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did Bolivar Win Independence for Northern South America?</b></i></span> In South America, the struggle for independence was marked by two major military campaigns, led by two key figures. In the north, Simon Bolivar led efforts to free what are now Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. In the south, Jose <i class="calibre8">de</i> San</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-527" class="calibre10"></a>Martin fought for independence in his native Argentina, as well as in Chile, Bolivia, and Peru.</p>
<p class="indent">Even before the Napoleonic Wars created a crisis in Spain, revolutionaries had sought independence in Venezuela, an autonomous region within the Viceroyalty of New Granada. In 1806, Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan who had fought in the American and French revolutions, launched an invasion of Venezuela from the United States with a single ship, but the expedition was easily defeated by the Spanish colonial regime.</p>
<p class="indent">After the Spanish king Ferdinand was deposed, the town council of Caracas, Venezuela, formed a <i class="calibre8">junta</i> in April 1810, and it soon proclaimed independence from Spain. Bolivar, a wealthy young aristocrat, was sent to London to seek support for the independence movement. Bolivar contacted Miranda and arranged for him to return to Caracas, where Miranda took control of the movement.</p>
<p class="indent">On July 5, 1811, a congress in Caracas proclaimed the Republic of Venezuela, known as the First Republic. However, royalist forces defeated the patriots, and Miranda, with cash and gold from the treasury, attempted to flee to Europe. He was turned over to the royalists and eventually sent to Spain, where he died in a prison in 1816. Bolivar, who had tried but failed to defend the strategic port of Puerto Cabello, escaped to New Granada. Venezuela’s First Republic remained independent for only about a year.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00122.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Bolivar’s Campaign</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-528" class="calibre10"></a>By the time Bolivar arrived in New Granada in 1812, an independence movement was under way there, and Bolivar fought against the royalist forces. In 1813, he took a small army into Venezuela, broke the royalist defenses, and on August 6, 1813, entered Caracas in triumph. He established Venezuela’s Second Republic with himself as dictator. A new congress proclaimed him <i class="calibre8">El Libertador</i>&mdash;the Liberator&mdash;and that is how he was known from that time. However, again Venezuela’s freedom was brief. The following June, Bolivar was easily defeated by royalist forces, and by the beginning of 1815, Venezuela was again a royal colony.</p>
<p class="indent">Once more, Bolivar escaped to New Granada. Leading patriot forces there, he captured Bogota. After King Ferdinand was restored to the throne, he sent a military force of more than 10,000 experienced troops to the colonies to enforce his rule. Spanish troops led by General Pablo Morillo, entered Caracas in May 1815. That same month, Bolivar sailed from New Granada to seek refuge on the island of Jamaica but continued his efforts to achieve Venezuelan independence. He sought help from Haiti, the former French colony where black slaves had rebelled and won independence a decade earlier. Haitian president Alexander Petion agreed to support Bolivar’s plan to defeat the royalists in Venezuela in return for Bolivar’s promise to free the slaves in all colonies that he might liberate. Most of the nations eventually ended slavery after winning independence, but usually under a slow, gradual process.</p>
<p class="indent">Bolivar ’s first attempted invasion of Venezuela ended in disaster, and he fled back to Haiti. Once more Petion gave him support, and in 1817, he returned to Venezuela, capturing the fortified town of Angostura (now Ciudad Bolivar). The town, a port on the Orinoco River, gave the patriots access to the Venezuelan plains and its rich resources, and provided a base from which to launch further campaigns.</p>
<p class="indent">The tide in the war for independence now turned in Bolivar’s favour. His army gained new strength as 4000 disciplined soldiers from Britain and other European nations, left idle when the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, volunteered to join his cause and sailed to Orinoco. He also won support from two other revolutionary groups: the llaneros, fierce cowboys of the Venezuelan plains, who became the patriot army’s cavalry under General Jose Antonio Paez, and patriot troops under Francisco Paula <i class="calibre8">de</i> Santander, a military officer from New Granada (Colombia).</p>
<p class="indent">In February 1819, a congress assembled in Angostura and proclaimed the Republic of Colombia. The republic, often referred to as Gran Colombia, consisted of Venezuela as well as the colonies of New Granada (now the nations of Colombia and Panama) and Quito (now the nation of Ecuador). Aside from the freed region of Venezuela, most of the republic was still held by royalist forces at the time of proclamation.</p>
<p class="indent">For the next phase of his military campaign, Bolivar decided to surprise the Spanish forces by striking at the vice-regal capital of Bogota, in Colombia. Bolivar led his army in a difficult and daring march across the Andes Mountains into present-day Colombia. The campaign took many lives, but his army survived the ordeal, and on August 7, 1819, he met and defeated the royalist forces in the Battle of Boyaca. After his victory at Boyaca, Bolivar entered Bogota as a conquering hero, then, returned to Angostura.</p>
<p class="indent">At this point, events in Spain again dramatically influenced the course of Spanish American independence. Ferdinand VII had been preparing to send a large military force from the Spanish port of Cadiz to defeat the independence movements. On January 1, 1820, troops stationed at Cadiz rebelled and were soon joined by army units from all over Spain, demanding a return to the liberal constitution <a id="calibre_link-529" class="calibre10"></a>of 1812. Rather than confront a revolt of this magnitude, Ferdinand in March accepted the 1812 constitution, which had created a limited constitutional monarchy. Spain then abandoned plans to send an army to subdue the colonies.</p>
<p class="indent">Bolivar next met the royalists in battle in Venezuela, on the plains of Carabobo. His victory at the Battle of Carabobo on June 24, 1821, finally ensured Venezuela’s independence. Of the former Viceroyalty of New Granada, only the department of Quito remained under royalist control. To liberate it, Bolivar chose General Antonio Jose <i class="calibre8">de</i> Sucre. On the high plains outside the city of Quito, Sucre defeated the royalists in the Battle of Pichincha on May 24, 1822. When Bolivar arrived in Quito in June, his dream of a liberated Republic of Colombia was a reality.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did San Martin Win Independence For Southern South America?</b></i></span> While patriots led by Bolivar sought independence in the north, a similar campaign began in Southern South America. Led by Argentine revolutionary, Jose <i class="calibre8">de</i> San Martin, the military campaign for independence spread from Argentina to Chile, then struck at the royalist stronghold of Peru.</p>
<p class="indent">In May 1810, when news reached Buenos Aires that the French in Spain had defeated forces loyal to King Ferdinand, the city’s residents deposed the viceroy and set up a council to govern in the king’s name. A few months later, on September 18, 1810, the town council of Santiago, Chile, also elected a <i class="calibre8">junta</i> to govern in the name of Ferdinand. In Argentina, support for independence grew, and on July 9, 1816, a congress of delegates from Buenos Aires and several interior provinces declared independence from Spain, calling the new nation the United Provinces of South America (later known as the United Provinces of the Rio <i class="calibre8">de la</i> Plata). In Chile, which was part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, Spanish officials sent forces to regain royal control. On October 1, 1814, the two sides met in a decisive battle at Rancagua, on the road to Santiago. The Chilean patriots, commanded by Bernardo O’Higgins, were defeated, and Chile became a royal colony again.</p>
<p class="indent">San Martin, a major leader of the independence movement in the region, was born in Argentina but had spent much of his life in Spain and made a career as an officer in the Spanish army. He sympathised with the colonists’ desire for freedom, and in 1812, he returned from Spain to Buenos Aires and helped organise and train the patriot army. By 1814, however, he had come to believe that for Argentina to remain free, the rest of the continent had to be liberated. Central to that goal was the liberation of the Viceroyalty of Peru. San Martin chose to attack the powerful viceroyalty by first freeing Chile. Thus, in 1814, he became governor of the Andean province of Cuyo to prepare for an invasion of Chile. After the defeat of Chilean independence forces at Rancagua, O’Higgins and several thousand other Chilean refugees fled toward Cuyo, San Martin’s province, and joined his plan to liberate their homeland and Peru.</p>
<p class="indent">San Martin, with the support of the central Argentine government, formed a combined Army of the Andes, made up of Argentines and Chileans. In January 1817, San Martin began to move his army toward the high Andean passes. To move thousands of men, their food, supplies, artillery, and munitions through narrow, rocky passes in very thin air was considered almost impossible. San Martin succeeded, surprising the royalists, who did not expect an attack over the Andes directly into Central Chile.</p>
<p class="indent">San Martin’s army met the royalist forces on the plains of Chacabuco, Northeast of Santiago, and easily defeated them. O’Higgins became supreme director of Chile. On February 12, 1818, Chile declared its independence from Spain. Fighting continued for months, but at the Battle of Maipú in April, the Chileans <a id="calibre_link-530" class="calibre10"></a>routed the royalists and secured the country’s independence.</p>
<p class="indent">San Martin could now concentrate on his plan to liberate Peru. In August 1820, San Martin’s army sailed to Peru on ships of the Chilean navy. On July 10, 1821, San Martin took Lima, the capital of the viceroyalty. Peru’s independence was proclaimed July 28, 1821, and San Martin became chief of state, with the title of Protector. Although San Martin was an excellent general, he made a poor government executive. Lima and part of Peru controlled by the patriots was on the verge of financial ruin, while the royalist army still controlled much of the countryside and the highlands.</p>
<p class="indent">One of San Martin’s central concerns was how to liberate the rest of Peru. In 1822, after Bolivar’s success in Colombia, San Martin received an invitation to meet with Bolivar in Guayaquil, Ecuador, to discuss the campaign to free Peru from Spanish rule.</p>
<p class="indent">The two great generals of Spanish American independence met in July 1822. What they said is not known, but after the meeting San Martin, the liberator of Chile and Lima, decided to retire, leaving Bolivar to lead the battle for Peru’s independence. San Martin, weakened by tuberculosis, returned to Lima, then to Argentina. He soon left for England, where he lived in exile.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was Independence Won in Rest of South America?</b></i></span> By early 1823, Peru was in chaos. Bolivar sent a Colombian army under the command of General Sucre to support the republican government. Sucre found the country virtually bankrupt, defended by a series of quasi-independent armies, with much of the productive lands held by the royalists. Bolivar decided to take charge of the campaign himself. He arrived in Lima on September 1, 1823, and was appointed military dictator and commander of all the armies of independent Peru.</p>
<p class="indent">Once again, events in Europe affected Spanish American independence. In 1823, a large French army invaded Spain to help restore royal absolutism against liberal forces. Britain and the United States feared this might undermine Spanish-American independence and their presence in the region’s growing markets. Britain, with its superior naval force, supported the independence of Latin America. United States president, James Monroe issued a declaration later known as the Monroe Doctrine, in which he warned against European intervention in the western hemisphere, especially in the emerging Spanish-American nations.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1824, Bolivar gathered an army of 9,000 troops in the highlands of Peru and prepared his offensive against the royalists. The future of South America was now to be decided. In the late afternoon of August 6, 1824, the patriot and royalist armies met in the Battle of Junin. After a short battle, the royalists were beaten.</p>
<p class="indent">Bolivar took a small force and returned to Lima, appointing Sucre commander of the army. Sucre then learned that a royalist army of nearly 10,000 troops was headed toward his force of fewer than 6000 soldiers. The armies met on the plain of Ayacucho, more than 10,000 feet high in the Andes. Sucre defeated the royalists on December 9, 1824, in the Battle of Ayacucho, the last major engagement of the wars for independence. Sucre then liberated Upper Peru, which declared its independence on August 6, 1825, and on August 11 took the name Bolivia, in honor of Bolivar. With the liberation of Peru, Spanish rule in South America came to an end.</p>
<p class="indent">The quest for independence quickly took the province of Paraguay, a large landlocked area in the north of Argentina, from colonial possession to an independent dictatorship. At the beginning of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, Paraguay, part of the Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata, held only about 120,000 people, mostly native <a id="calibre_link-531" class="calibre10"></a>Guarani peoples and mestizos. When the Paraguayans learned that residents of Buenos Aires had formed a <i class="calibre8">junta</i> in 1810, they created one of their own in Asuncion. The Paraguayan <i class="calibre8">junta</i>, like the one in Buenos Aires, supported King Ferdinand, but it would not be subservient to Buenos Aires. The Argentines sent an army to Paraguay, but it was defeated. On May 14, 1811, Paraguay declared its independence. A congress of delegates from all parts of Paraguay met and formed a new governing junta, and one of its members, Jose Gaspar Rodriguez <i class="calibre8">de</i> Francia, a doctor of theology and a lawyer, soon became the country’s dictator. In 1816, a congress elected Francia dictator of the republic for life. For the next 26 years, Francia ruled Paraguay with an iron hand, without a national congress or judiciary. He permitted Paraguay practically no contact with the outside world.</p>
<p class="indent">Under Spanish rule, Uruguay was known as the Banda Oriental (Eastern Shore), a frontier region of the Viceroyalty of the Rio <i class="calibre8">de la</i> Plata. Its capital, Montevideo, was an important port city rivalling Buenos Aires. After the viceroy was overthrown, a Uruguayan independence movement began, led by Jose Gervasio Artigas, who formed an army of cowboys known as gauchos. Pro-independence forces from Buenos Aires helped to drive the Spaniards out of Montevideo in 1814. Conflicts arose as Artigas established control over the region and sought autonomy rather than domination by Buenos Aires.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1816, the Banda Oriental was attacked by the Portuguese in neighbouring Brazil, and Montevideo was captured the following year. In 1820, Brazil defeated Artigas’s forces and annexed the region. Artigas went into exile in Paraguay, never to return. Uruguayans rebelled against Brazilian authority and, aided by Argentina, fought a war that ended in 1828 with recognition of Uruguay’s independence as the <i class="calibre8">República Oriental del Uruguay</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was Independence Won in Mexico and Rest of Central America?</b></i></span> The independence movement in Mexico took a different course from the campaigns in South America. Concerned about the crisis in Spain, a small group of peninsulares, rather than Creoles, carried out a coup <i class="calibre8">d’etat</i> in 1808. The peninsulares desired stability in Mexico and overthrew the Viceregal government when it allowed the Creoles influence. As a result, the great Viceroyalty of New Spain (Mexico), a huge region of more than six million people, was governed by some 15,000 peninsulares.</p>
<p class="indent">Two years after this coup, a widespread rebellion erupted. Creoles, including a priest named Miguel Hidalgo <i class="calibre8">y</i> Costilla, had been planning an uprising against the peninsulares, but their plot was discovered before they had organised their forces to take action. Hidalgo hurriedly launched the revolt on September 16, 1810, ringing the bell of his parish Church in the village of Dolores and summoning the Native American population to fight the peninsulares in the name of Ferdinand VII. In his famous Grito <i class="calibre8">de</i> Dolores, Hidalgo called for independence and reforms to benefit the oppressed Native Americans. Hidalgo’s call set off a massive revolt by tens of thousands of Native Americans north of Mexico City, who were suffering the effects of rising food prices and falling wages. The Native Americans were joined by mestizos and mulattoes, who also were hurt by the economy.</p>
<p class="indent">The revolt was extremely destructive, as Hidalgo’s army vented its rage over years of oppression. The damage to haciendas and mines retarded Mexico’s economic development for decades after the revolt ended. Facing such violent rebellion, few of Mexico’s Creoles joined Hidalgo, instead supporting the peninsulares, whose government offered stability.</p>
<p class="indent">After initial victories, Hidalgo marched his army of about 80,000 to Mexico City. Knowing <a id="calibre_link-532" class="calibre10"></a>that his army would turn into a mob if it captured the capital and aware that a royal army was approaching, Hidalgo withdrew. While retreating, his army was defeated by the royalists in January 1811. Hidalgo was captured by the royalists in March and executed on July 30, 1811.</p>
<p class="indent">Hidalgo was replaced by another parish priest, Jose Maria Morelosy Pavon. Morelos, a mestizo, was a better military tactician than Hidalgo. He had a more specific political agenda, which called for social and racial equality as well as independence from Spain. Under his leadership, the patriots captured some territory and declared independence in 1813. The royalists still controlled the capital and much of the viceroyalty. In 1815, Morelos was captured and executed. For the next six years, the rebellion continued on a smaller scale, much of it carried out by provincial guerrilla bands.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1820, the royalists chose Agustin <i class="calibre8">de</i> Iturbide, a Creole officer in the royalist army, to defeat the remaining guerrillas. Iturbide immediately set out to find the most important rebel leader, Vicente Guerrero, a mestizo. Instead of defeating Guerrero, Iturbide made a deal with him to overthrow Spanish authority. In February 1821, they issued their plan, which declared the independence of Mexico. The plan’s three major provisions called for creation of a monarchy with limited powers, for Catholicism to be the official state religion, and for racial equality. Iturbide and Guerrero’s forces joined to form the Army of the Three Guarantees. It won immediate support from royalists, since it kept Mexico a monarchy, and from patriots, since it created an independent Mexico. When a new viceroy arrived from Spain in 1821, he and Iturbide signed the Treaty of Cordoba, based largely on the Plan of Iguala, and the independent Mexican empire was created.</p>
<p class="indent">The governing <i class="calibre8">junta</i> of Mexico City appointed Iturbide its president in September 1821. Under the treaty, a member of European royalty was to be offered the throne of the new empire, but before arrangements could be made Iturbide himself became Emperor Agustin I in May 1822.</p>
<p class="indent">Agustin had to govern a large empire with a weak and disrupted economy. Revolts against his government began soon after he took office. In 1823, the emperor resigned and went into exile, and a republic was proclaimed, but the country continued to be divided among political factions. Agustin returned to Mexico the following year, but was imprisoned and then executed.</p>
<p class="indent">Under colonial rule, most of Central America was part of the captaincy-general of Guatemala, a fairly autonomous region of New Spain. The captaincy-general, led by Gabino Gainza, declared its independence on September 15, 1821, and later joined the short-lived Mexican Empire. When the empire dissolved, Central America declared its independence once again, this time on July 1, 1823. The Constitution of 1824 created a federation, the United Provinces of Central America, which included Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p class="indent">The federation was designed to reduce the influence of the former province of Guatemala over its neighbors. Although the federation was a land of abundant natural resources and great potential, the issue of political control could not be resolved. The republic’s first congress met in 1825, but a civil war broke out in 1826, lasting three years. By 1831, the Central American economy was deteriorating, and by the end of the decade the federation broke apart. It was replaced by the independent republics of Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was Independence Won in the Caribbeans?</b></i></span> Of the three Spanish colonies in the Caribbean, only Santo Domingo, on the island of Hispaniola, achieved independence <a id="calibre_link-533" class="calibre10"></a>before the end of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until 1898, then came under the political control of the United States.</p>
<p class="indent">The French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue, however, played a role in the Latin American independence movement. The colony, which adjoined Santo Domingo, became the nation of Haiti in 1804, the second independent nation in the western hemisphere, after the United States. Haiti achieved its independence after its black slave population rebelled against white slave owners. The uprising, fuelled by the ideas of the French Revolution, became a full-fledged social revolution that destroyed the island’s plantation economy and transformed its social structure.</p>
<p class="indent">After defeating French forces, Haiti’s rulers then assisted Bolivar in his quest to free Spanish South America from colonial rule and urged him to abolish slavery in newly liberated nations. The bloodshed and destruction in Haiti also served as a frightening example to the white elites of Latin America. In areas with large slave populations, such as Cuba and to a lesser degree Puerto Rico, the elite planter class remained loyal to the crown rather than joining the independence movement, fearing that it could bring similar chaos to their homelands.</p>
<p class="indent">During the Haitian Revolution, Santo Domingo was controlled for a time by Haiti. It was again a Spanish colony from 1809 to 1821. The Dominicans then rebelled and declared their independence from Spain, but in 1822, the Haitians again invaded and annexed the colony. In 1844, Santo Domingo again declared its independence, forming the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p class="indent">In Cuba, harsh Spanish rule beginning in the 1830s prompted some colonists to launch plots and revolts against Spain. Some Cubans sought independence, while others favoured annexation by the United States. A revolution in 1868, which became known as the Ten Years’ War, ended with Spain’s abolishing slavery and promising reform. But the promises were not kept, leading to a war of independence in 1895. The United States intervened on the side of the Cubans in the Spanish-American War in 1898. The treaty ending the war ended Spanish rule over Cuba and ceded Puerto Rico to the United States. A U.S. military government ruled Cuba until 1902, when the Cuban Republic was proclaimed, but the United States continued to exert a strong influence over Cuban affairs for decades.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did Brazil Gain Independence from Portugal?</b></i></span> Portugal’s empire in the Americas had a smoother passage to independence than the Spanish colonies. Portuguese Brazil, by far the largest colony in the Americas, achieved its freedom without warfare and formed a single nation more easily than did many of the smaller Spanish colonies.</p>
<p class="indent">Like Spain, Portugal did little to build an effective system of internal communications in Brazil. The enormous colony’s productive regions had little need to communicate with each other: The cattle ranchers of the south, the gold and diamond miners of the interior, and the sugar planters of the northeast sent most of their output to Portugal rather than to other regions within Brazil.</p>
<p class="indent">From the 1750s to 1777, the Portuguese monarchy sought to gain more revenue from its colony through a series of reforms, similar in some ways to the Bourbon reforms in the Spanish colonies. To stimulate Brazil’s economy and make its administration more efficient, Portugal gave more power to royal bureaucrats, increased trade by opening up commerce between more ports, and sought to increase production of gold, sugar and new crops, such as cacao, rice and cotton. Just as in Spanish America, the monarch expelled the wealthy and powerful Jesuits, who wielded great influence over the Native Americans.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-534" class="calibre10"></a>However, unlike the Spanish colonies, Brazil had little division or resentment between European- and American-born colonists. The Portuguese reforms did not favour Europeans over Brazilians for important posts, and the huge population of African slaves fostered unity among the small number of whites.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1777, Queen Maria I inherited the Portuguese throne and reversed some of these reform efforts. Although the monarchy permitted no university or even a printing press in Brazil, the ideas of the Enlightenment found their way into the colony. Conspiracies against the imperial system occurred during the late 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The two most important were the Inconfidencia and the Conspiracy of the Tailors. The Inconfidencia (1788&ndash;1789) was planned in the mining region of Minas Gerais, in Eastern Brazil. Inspired by the American Revolution (1775&ndash;1783), it protested Portuguese mining taxes. The conspirators proposed to establish a republic in Minas Gerais, but their plans were discovered and the government easily destroyed the conspiracy. The Conspiracy of the Tailors was organised in 1798 in the Northeastern city of Salvador. This conspiracy advocated independence and the establishment of a democratic government, based on French revolutionary ideals of social and racial equality. But the plot was discovered and quickly ended. Although other conspiracies arose, the colony endured.</p>
<p class="indent">When Napoleon invaded Portugal in 1807, Queen Maria, her son Prince John (Joao), and her court fled to Brazil. They made Rio de Janeiro the seat of Portuguese government. Even after the French were driven from Portugal, the royal family chose to stay in Brazil, which in 1815 was elevated to the status of a kingdom equal to Portugal. When Maria died in 1816, her son became King John VI and ruled both kingdoms.</p>
<p class="indent">In early March 1817, the Revolution of Pernambuco took place, proclaiming an independent Republic of Pernambuco in Northeast Brazil. The movement attracted wide support among various social groups and spread to the region beyond Pernambuco. The attempt at independence was put down by loyal troops in late May 1817.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1820, a liberal revolt took place in Portugal, seeking a constitutional government. This had a profound effect on the status of Brazil. The reformers in Portugal demanded that the king return to rule from Lisbon. John VI agreed, leaving his son Pedro as regent of Brazil. The Portuguese legislature then tried to return Brazil to its status as a colony, ordering Pedro to return to Europe as well. Responding to pressure from Brazilians, Pedro refused and declared Brazil independent in September 1822, in a statement known as the <i class="calibre8">Grito de Ipiranga</i>, in which he called for “Independence or Death”.</p>
<p class="indent">The following year he became emperor of Brazil as Pedro I. The political system of the new empire was solidified in the Constitution of 1824, which created a limited constitutional monarchy, with an elected chamber of deputies and a hereditary senate. However, Pedro I held great power, and Brazil remained a monarchy until 1889.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">Course of Latin American Independence</b></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were Post-Independence Problems of Latin America?</b></i></span> By the middle of the 1820s almost all of the Latin American colonies had achieved independence. The new Spanish American nations, with a combined population of about 16 million, and Brazil, with nearly four million people, now faced many difficult political, social, and economic issues.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the first problems was to establish their own governments and bureaucracies. Except for the early empire in Mexico, the Spanish American countries established republics, with presidents, congresses, and courts. Only Paraguay, under the Francia dictatorship, was governed without a legislature or judiciary. Brazil established an empire that endured until the end of the century.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-535" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00051.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">The America, 1800&ndash;1836</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-536" class="calibre10"></a>The most famous political theorist of the Spanish American independence period was Simon Bolivar. In 1815, Bolivar favoured the establishment of republics modelled on the British example, with a president appointed for life (but not hereditary) rather than a king. He advocated a legislature with a hereditary upper house and an elected lower house. By early 1819, Bolivar had become strongly republican, even favouring frequent elections so that no administration would become too powerful. He still favoured a strong executive, balanced by a hereditary senate and an independent judiciary. The constitution he wrote in 1825 for Bolivia, where he served as president, established a president with life tenure and a strong legislature with three houses: tribunes, senators, and censors.</p>
<p class="indent">All of the constitutions established by the new nations in Latin America had two fundamental things in common. They were all dedicated to the preservation of private property, and they all permitted only a small percentage of adult males to vote or hold public office.</p>
<p class="indent">However, although they began as civil wars to break the ties of colonialism, the Spanish-American independence movements did have a revolutionary outcome on society. The new republics increased the freedom of Native Americans, mestizos, people of colour, and often women. While the Spanish colonial regime had excluded non-whites from positions of authority in government and the army, in the new nations, mestizos, men of colour, and native Americans became generals and presidents. Black slavery was gradually abolished. Independence did not create open societies, but the new nations offered greater access to political and economic opportunity than the colonial system had permitted.</p>
<p class="indent">The role of the Catholic Church in society became a major issue of conflict in many of the new nations. The Church held huge amounts of land and wealth in the former colonies, and therefore wielded great economic and political power. It also controlled most educational institutions, hospitals, cemeteries, and charitable institutions, and played a role in recording births, deaths, and marriages. Although liberal forces sought to separate Church and state and curb religious power, the Church still exerted strong influence among the population, especially the lower classes. Some liberal governments confiscated Church land and expelled clergy, but in some cases, such as Mexico, officials who challenged the power of the Church were overthrown.</p>
<p class="indent">After achieving independence from Spain, Spanish Americans divided into liberal and conservative factions within their new nations. The liberals favoured low tariffs, limits on the power of the Catholic Church, secular education, and weakened militaries. Conservatives favoured higher tariffs; a privileged position for the Catholic Church, including Church-run education; and a strong military. Conservatives in Mexico also favoured monarchy. However, some people were liberal on some issues and conservative on others.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of years of colonial rule, Spanish Americans had little experience in representative government. The wars of independence had, however, produced soldiers who wanted to dominate the new governments. Countries that could not control their military forces often ended up controlled by them. Many nations came to be ruled by military strongmen, setting a pattern that continued in places into the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="indent">The new nations also faced economic problems. Ports and roads were not sufficiently developed, and economies were not usually well-balanced, since the colonial system had emphasised mostly exports. The years of warfare had destroyed much of the productive capacity of many of the new nations, including <a id="calibre_link-537" class="calibre10"></a>haciendas, plantations, and mines. Many of the new nations had incurred large government debt to pay for the war effort, which limited their capacity to support economic development.</p>
<p class="indent">The most disruptive problem for the new nations was the issue of federalism, uniting individual states or regions under a central government. Neither Spain or Portugal had encouraged a sense of Nationalism in the colonies, which would have been counter to the interests of Colonialism, so the new nations had little sense of unity. After achieving independence, regions fought each other politically and often militarily over the control of ports and customs revenue, and over the allocation of government funds for economic development.</p>
<p class="indent">This issue destroyed the United Provinces of Central America. The merchants of Guatemala City had controlled the important indigo trade during the colonial period and wanted to continue to do so after independence, but merchants and farmers in other provinces objected. The regional capitals also desired more political power than the centralised government would allow. The result was civil war and the collapse of the federation into separate nations.</p>
<p class="indent">Argentina also had a difficult time achieving a centralised state. The main problem was who should control the port of Buenos Aires and the customs revenue collected there. Disputes also arose over protective tariffs, taxes on imported or exported goods. The province of Buenos Aires and several other provinces produced pastoral and agricultural products that sold well in the international market. Therefore, these provinces did not need or want high protective tariffs; they wanted to sell their products abroad and import cheap manufactured goods. However, they did not want to be dominated politically by the residents of Buenos Aires. On the other hand, provinces that produced items that needed protection from imported goods wanted higher tariffs. These areas also resented the political and economic power of the province and port of Buenos Aires. A solution was reached in 1862, when the Buenos Aires customs house was placed under the control of the nation rather than Buenos Aires.</p>
<p class="indent">One newly independent country had almost no realistic chance of succeeding: the Republic of Colombia, created by Bolivar. The provincial capitals of the new country were too far from Bogota and their economic interests too different for such a large country to function effectively. Led by Jose <i class="calibre8">de</i> Paez, Venezuela seceded from the Republic of Colombia. Juan Jose Flores soon led Ecuador out of the republic as well, becoming that country’s first president. In 1832, Francisco Paula <i class="calibre8">de</i> Santander, who had been exiled in 1828, returned to Bogota and became president of New Granada. What had briefly been the Republic of Colombia became three independent nations.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was the Role of Simon Bolivar?</b></i></span> Simon Bolivar (1783&ndash;1830) was one of South America’s greatest generals. His victories over the Spaniards won independence for Bolivia, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. He is known as <i class="calibre8">El Liberator</i> (The Liberator) and the “George Washington of South America”. Born on July 24, 1783, at Caracas in Venezuela, Bolivar lost his parents in his childhood itself but inherited a fortune. In his young age, he toured all over Europe.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00078.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Simon Bolivar</p>
<p class="indent">As he returned to Venezuela, Bolivar joined the group of patriots that seized Caracas in 1810 and proclaimed independence from Spain. He went to Great <a id="calibre_link-538" class="calibre10"></a>Britain in search of aid, but could get only a promise of British neutrality. When he returned to Venezuela, and took command of a patriot army, he recaptured Caracas in 1813 from the Spaniards.</p>
<p class="indent">The Spaniards forced Bolivar to retreat from Venezuela to New Granada (now Colombia), also at war with Spain. He took command of a Colombian force and captured Bogota in 1814. The patriots, however, lacked men and supplies, and new defeats led Bolivar to flee to Jamaica. In Haiti, he gathered a force that landed in Venezuela in 1816, and took Angostura (now Ciudad Bolivar). He also became dictator there.</p>
<p class="indent">Bolivar marched into New Granada in 1819. He defeated the Spaniards in Boyar in 1819, liberating the territory of Colombia. He then returned to Angostura and led the congress that organised the original republic of Colombia (now Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela). Bolivar became its first president on December 17, 1819.</p>
<p class="indent">Bolivar routed the Spanish army at Carabobo in Venezuela in 1821, before marching into Ecuador and merging it to the new Colombian republic. Following a meeting in 1822 with another great liberator, Bolivar gained control over Peru. His army scored a resounding victory over the Spaniards at Auacucho in 1824. This final victory brought the Spanish power to an end in South America. Upper Peru that became a separate state in 1825, came to be known as Bolivia in Bolivar’s honour. The constitution, which he drew up for Bolivia, is one of his most important political pronouncements.</p>
<p class="indent">What happened to Simon Bolivar? As divisions within the country continued, the man known as the liberator of Spanish America resigned the presidency of Colombia in March 1830. He left Bogota on his final journey on May 8, 1830, travelling slowly down the Magdalena River to the coast, heading into exile, perhaps in Britain. He was in poor health, suffering from tuberculosis, and his condition worsened during the trip. He did not reach his destination. He died on December 17, 1830, at the age of 47. Although disillusioned by the results of his long battle for independence, Bolivar became a hero whose birthday is celebrated as a national holiday in several of the countries he liberated.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-72"><b class="calibre9">AWAKENING IN THE ARAB WORLD&ndash;EGYPT</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The day in 1798 when Napoleon landed on the shores of Egypt with his army is held by many to be the time when the awakening of the Arab world began. Napoleon’s objective in landing in Egypt was to strike at Britain’s position in the East, but after being defeated by Admiral Nelson’s fleet at Alexandria, he gave up his objective and returned home. Napoleon’s very brief stay in Egypt had a lasting effect on the country, for it was more than a mere military affair. It was also a cultural invasion by the West. Napoleon brought with him the first printing press. He was accompanied by scientists who could decipher the ancient hieroglyphic writing, and by engineers who prepared plans for joining the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Napoleon also destroyed the power of the well entrenched ruling class (Mamluks) in Egypt.</p>
<p class="indent">This led to the rise to power of an Arabian adventurer and genius, Mohammed Ali. He is a significant figure in history because he was the first Middle Eastern ruler who realised the value of western science and used it most efficiently to suit his purposes. His achievements were numerous and revolutionary and thanks to Napoleon’s expedition and Ali’s efforts, Egypt became the most important bridgehead for Westernism in the Arab world. After 1870, Egypt’s position of supremacy was taken over by Syria, which included the entire Levant <a id="calibre_link-539" class="calibre10"></a>coast (Arab side of the Mediterranean). Syria rivalled Egypt as a centre for western influence. One reason was the flourishing trade between Syria and Europe, and the numerous Syrian merchants who travelled abroad. These traders had a great catalytic affect upon their fellow countrymen. Missionary educational activity undertaken by the French Jesuits and American Presbyterians was another factor in Syria’s enlightenment. The missionaries established schools in Syria that trained Arab students and printed and distributed Arab books. The Syrians were, in this manner, able to rediscover their past and learn Western literature, ideology and technology.</p>
<p class="indent">These outside influences were responsible for the earliest signs of Arab Nationalism. The leaders were in the beginning usually Christian Arabs, since Muslims did not enrol in the missionary schools until a later date. In 1860, Butros <i class="calibre8">el</i> Bustani, a convert to Protestantism, began publishing the first newspaper in Syria. He also started a political and scientific journal few years later. Bustani and other pioneer nationalists could not carry on political agitation openly because of the repressive measures of the Ottoman authorities. As a result of this, the first avowedly political activity was the organisation of a secret revolutionary society in 1875 by a group of students. They drew up a national programme which included demands for self-government, freedom of the press and the adoption of Arabic as the official language. They panicked when the Turkish officials attempted to uncover the leadership of the secret society, and moved to Egypt where imperial agents had no power.</p>
<p class="indent">These western educated Syrian intellectuals published newspapers and magazines which made Egyptians familiar with contemporary literary and scientific thought in Europe. Simultaneously, the deciphering of hieroglyph, the establishment of museums and the growth of Egyptology aroused interest and generated awareness of Egypt’s ancient history and a pride in her achievement. This nascent nationalism was further aroused by the growing western domination of the country. This domination was possible because of Khedive Ismail’s heavy borrowings on the European money market which led to bankruptcy and finally foreign military intervention and rule.</p>
<p class="indent">In these circumstances, a nationalist revolt broke out in 1882 under the leadership of an Egyptian army officer, Ahmed Arabi. It was directed partly against foreign intervention in Egyptian affairs and partly against the Khedive and the Turkish oligarchies. After some rioting and loss of life in Alexandria, a British force landed in Egypt and defeated Arabi. Egypt was still nominally a Turkish province, but Britain now controlled the country in every respect economically, militarily and politically.</p>
<p class="noindent">Anti-foreign sentiments were a natural result of the provocation, but these were directed more against the westerners than the Turks. During this time, only a few Christians (Arabs) wanted to break away from Constantinople. The masses were largely apathetic, while the politically conscious Muslim minority wanted autonomy within the Ottoman imperial structure.</p>
<p class="indent">When the Young Turks revolted in 1908, it seemed as if this desire would be satisfied. The Arabs, like others in the empire, welcomed the revolt with enthusiasm. But the enthusiasm was short lived, for the Young Turk leaders soon resorted to severe Turkification measures to hold the empire together against foreign military aggression and internal nationalist subversion. The Arabs and the Balkan Christians resented this, but most Arabs ill aspired for full autonomy under the Turks rather than independence. These were the sentiments of the majority of Arabs until the outbreak of World War I. Then the decision of the Young Turk leaders to join the Central Powers changed things overnight. A chain reaction of events began that climaxed in <a id="calibre_link-540" class="calibre10"></a>the Arab Revolt of 1916 and the disappearance of the Ottoman Empire after World War I.</p>
<p class="indent">After the Paris Peace Treaty (1919) the Arabs resented the Mandatory Powers to which they had been assigned, contrary to war-time promises. Syria and Lebanon were given as mandates to France, Mesopotamia and Palestine to England. This high-handed parcelling out of Arab lands inevitably led to trouble, because the war itself had stimulated tremendous national sentiments among the Arabs. Soon, a common pattern emerged in the post-war struggle for independence. First, an explosion of defiance and armed revolt occurred in the years following the peace treaties. Then gradually, France and Britain restored order and re-established authority. Finally varying degrees of autonomy were granted, which did not completely satisfy the nationalists, but which led to uneasy peace until World War II.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was the Freedom Struggle in Egypt before 1918?</b></i></span> The main cause for the struggle for freedom and reform in Egypt was the colonisation of Egyptian economy and its subsequent adverse effects on the people of Egypt. Along with the economic colonisation, the foreign powers, particularly the British, exercised too much control over the Egyptian government, which naturally caused anti-foreign feelings among the Egyptians. Secondly, due to the introduction of western education in Egypt a new class of young Egyptians with liberal and nationalist ideas of contemporary Europe emerged. Thirdly, the people of Egypt were naturally influenced by the anti-imperialist and nationalist movements all over the world, particularly in Asia and Africa. The first phase of the Egyptian struggle for freedom in the pre-war period covers the period between 1879 and 1895. During the period there were three groups of national resistance in Cairo. There was the Islamic Renaissance under Jamal Din and Mohammed Abdur. Then there was a group led by an army officer, Arabi. In 1881, Arabi led a military demonstration and the Pasha had to accept the nationalist government put up by him and his followers with Arabi as Under Secretary for War. The activities of this government leading to its dismissal due to the pressure exerted on the king by the British and the French have been dealt with earlier in the context of Colonialism in Egypt.</p>
<p class="indent">The second phase of the struggle covers the period between 1895 and 1918. Taking advantage of the grievances among the Egyptians, particularly the educated middle classes, Mustafa Kemal formed the Nationalist Party in 1895. The grievances of the Egyptians were to some extent fanned by the French, who were resenting the abolition of the dual control by the British in 1882, and who had a virtual monopoly of higher education and cultural and political propaganda.</p>
<p class="indent">While Cromer did not reject the idea of self-government as ultimate goal of the Egypt’s political evolution, he had many doubts about Egyptian administrative abilities. The very large foreign interest he had in mind comprised not only the 2.5 per cent of the population that was foreign, but the fact that 78 per cent of the Egyptian public debt and joint-stock capital was in foreign hands.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1904, the Anglo-French Treaty gave a blow to Egypt’s patriotism. The French would no longer actively support Britain’s enemies in Egypt. The nationalists too had their shortcomings. They were not thinking in a coherent policy and ideology, which was very essential. It was because of the rising national fervour that the directive which Sir Eldon Gorst (Cromer’s successor) received, made allowances for greater freedom of action to Egyptian government in mattes of administration and other policies. Due to this development, the enthusiasm among the nationalists was greater. Britain persisted in her occupation of Egypt and in exercising control over the Egyptian <a id="calibre_link-541" class="calibre10"></a>government, for the control of the Suez Canal was very vital to her imperial communications, and in addition to her prestige a large sum of British capital was committed in Egypt.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was it After 1918?</b></i></span> The post-war situation was very grim and the grievances were aggravated. Egypt was proclaimed a British protectorate almost as an occupied territory in which the rights and wishes of the inhabitants counted for little. There was conscription of thousands of felaheen (peasants) for the labour crops and canal transport corps. The urban population was made discontent by the shortage of important supplies, especially cereals, due to the transformation of Egyptian economy into a one-crop (cotton) economy. The Egyptians were also offended by the tactless collection of subscriptions for the Red Cross. Moreover, the prospect of self-government seemed even more remote now. In the field of banking again, there was foreign control. The Egyptian currency came to be tied to the pound. It is interesting to note that though Egypt was a large producer of cotton, it did not have a single cotton mill, except ginning and spinning mills before the war. Significant development in the industrial sphere occurred only in the year 1930. Meanwhile, the nationalist agitation was growing. So strikes, disturbances and riots became a normal feature. But Lord Curzon, the acting Foreign Secretary, refused to concede their demands, and at the Versailles Peace Conference, the Egyptian P.M. was denied permission to plead his country’s case. This led to widespread insurrection. Communications were cut, Cairo was isolated, provincial republic governments were set up and even villages established their own independent authorities. Some Europeans were even massacred.</p>
<p class="indent">Lloyd George, the Prime Minister of Britain, then appointed Lord Allenby as the new High Commissioner to maintain the protectorate on a secure and equitable basis. The aim was clearly the protection of foreign interest, and if at all self-governing institutions were to be developed, it was to be under the protectorate. In the same document, the British policy was defined as seeking to defend Egypt against all external danger and the interference of a foreign power and to establish a constitutional government under the British guidance.</p>
<p class="indent">Naturally, this was met by a complete boycott. Negotiations were held and finally in August 1920, a memorandum was produced. It <a id="calibre_link-542" class="calibre10"></a>recommended a treaty of alliance under which the British would recognise the independence of Egypt as a constitutional monarchy with representative institutions. Egypt was to confer upon the British the rights necessary to safeguard her special interests and to enable her to give foreign powers guarantees which would secure the relinquishment of capitulatory rights. In the case of war, Egypt would render Britain all assistance in her power within her own borders. Egypt would not enter into any agreement with any foreign power prejudicial to British interests. The British also got the right to maintain a military force on the Egyptian soil.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00024.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">This memorandum of 1920 provided the basis for Anglo-Egyptian relations until 1946. It also caused reactions among the nationalists. There were more riots. On 29<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> February 1922, Egypt was granted independence subject to four points reserved for future negotiations. They were regarding the canal, garrison, capitulation, etc. Saud became the new King of Egypt. The British Colonial Secretary, Lord Milner, too was opposed to the August 1920 plans, but for different reasons. Confusion and chaos reigned supreme. The nationalist agitation was primarily responsible for all this. Besides, there was always the gap between the declared policy of the British and their practice. It was not until 1923 that Egyptian independence got recognition.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did Arab Nationalism Rise?</b></i></span> One of the most important factors for the rise of Arab nationalism was the role of the religious reformers. Several religious reforms attempted to revive the Arabic culture, and this instilled a sense of pride in their heritage. The most important among them was Abdul Wahaab, who belonged to the 18<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The movement that was begun by him came to be known as the Wahaabi Movement. Abdul Wahaab advocated strict adherence to the Quranic injunctions and emphasised catholicity in religion. He shunned the primitive religious dogmas and usages, and practices like veneration of saints, decoration of houses and religious places, etc. The movement soon spread to many parts of Arabia, and after the death of Abdul Wahaab, it was led by Muhammad bin Saud. Though the Turkish Sultan tried to suppress the movement by force, the Wahaabi movement spread rapidly to many areas like Najd, Mecca, Medina, Hejaz, Damascus, Alleppe, etc. They even succeeded in setting up a new state with Riyadh as the capital. Until World War I, they were operating from this centre, and during the war the British showed interest in the Wahaabi movement, which greatly awakened the Arabs to realise their political aspirations and build a nation for themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Through the western literature, the ideas of Nationalism spread into Syria, Lebanon and other Arab lands. The arrival of the Jesuit fathers, Catholic missionaries of France and the American Presbyterian missionaries bought about the spread of western education. A teachers’ training college was established in Lebanon while the Syrian Protestant College was founded in Beirut in 1866 which became the American University later on. Young men from all over the Arab world gathered in these centres for acquiring advanced knowledge. The establishment of St. Joseph’s University in Beirut was of great significance, for it produced eminent leaders among the Syrians. The role of the intellectuals is equally important. Among them Abdur Rahman-Al-Kawakibi can be considered as the father of Arab Nationalism. He advocated the transfer of the Caliphate to a member of the Quraish tribe. His four principles of Islamic revivalism, Arab Nationalism, westernisation and Constitutionalism attracted the Arabs. These ideals formed the basis of Arab Nationalist movement. He insisted on the separation of Arab Nationalism from Pan-Islamism. He enlightened the masses and condemned theologians who influenced the educational system. Other important <a id="calibre_link-543" class="calibre10"></a>intellectual personalities who instilled the spirit of Nationalism among the Arabs were Ibrahim Yaziji, Butros el Bustani, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, it may be pointed out that the liberation movements in the Balkans against the Turkish rule and their success also gave a great amount of confidence to the Arabs that they would also be able to achieve their objective of national independence.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did the Movement Rise and Grow?</b></i></span> The rise and growth of Arab Nationalism can be seen in three phases. First, it was an idealistic movement in which only the intellectuals took part. They worked for a constitutional government, through which they anticipated liberty and equality. The second phase was realistic. In this period, the nationalists demanded decentralisation and autonomy. The third phase witnessed a revolutionary movement. The nationalists resolved to fight for their rights and obtain them rather than compromise with the Turkish rule. In fact, the Young Turk movement stimulated the Arab national movement. In the earlier stages, the Arab nationalists found common cause with the liberal and broad-minded Young Turks. But after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, the Arabs were disappointed by the attitude of the Young Turks. The policy of Turkification and Ottomanisation of the Young Turks shattered all hopes of the Arabs for a constitutional liberalism. So, they resolved to fight, instead of plead, for their rights.</p>
<p class="indent">Several secret societies were founded by the Arabs indifferent cities of the Middle East to spread the idea of a separate state for the Arabs. The ‘Literary Club’ was an important secret society established in Istanbul. It did not openly entertain political activities as its purpose. Several of its branches came into being in Syria and Iraq. The leading Arab public men formed the Ottoman Decentralisation Party in Cairo in 1912. It stood for federal structure of the Ottoman Empire. It had its branches in Iraq and Syria. In the name of a legendary ancestor, another society, viz. Kahtanal-Kahtaniya, was established. This organisation stood for a dual Turko-Arab empire. Hurriyat Ittefaq, or the Freedom and Concord Party, was founded in 1911. It demanded complete decentralisation of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p class="indent">The Arabs exiled by the Young Turks gathered in Paris in increasing numbers. Among them Najib Azuri was prominent. He established the League of the Arab Fatherland. Najib Azuri began publishing a newspaper, viz. Arab Independence, from 1907. The Al-Fatator, the Young Arab Society was founded by the Arab refugees in 1911 in Paris. It aimed at complete independence for the Arabs. Its headquarters was shifted to Beirut in 1913, and later to Damascus in 1914. It obtained a large following very soon. In Paris, a congress of the Arabs was convened under the auspices of Al-Fatat. It was attended by the representatives of most of the Arab political parties and organisations, and they passed a resolution demanding more political reforms. Even in Beirut, a committee of reform met and openly professed the programme of Arab homerule. Though the Young Turk government tried to suppress these activities of the Arab nationalists at home and abroad the popular support enjoyed by the Arab nationalists forced the Young Turks to issue an imperial decree in 1913 to introduce reforms in the Arab provinces. However, this decree was never implemented by the Turkish government.</p>
<p class="indent">The Arab officers in the Turkish army formed an organisation, called the Covenant-al-Ahd. Its membership was restricted only to the army staff. Major Aziz Ali al-Masri was its leader. He was arrested in 1914 and was given death sentence. However, the heroic deeds of Aziz Ali in the previous wars against the enemies of Turkey and his membership of the former ‘Union and Progress Committee’ (of the Young Turks) had won for him a conspicuous place. The public opinion did not endorse the death sentence awarded to him on grounds of treason. <a id="calibre_link-544" class="calibre10"></a>Therefore, he was let free to go to Egypt, where he was given a hero’s welcome.</p>
<p class="indent">When the war clouds were gathering in the European continent, the Arab national aspirations were taking a clear shape. A section of them felt that by joining with the Entente Powers (Britain, France and Russia) who proclaimed it as their policy to support national self-determination, the Arabs could realise their national aspirations. Another section held that they had neither kinship nor affinity with the Europeans who always wished that Middle East was partitioned. Therefore, they considered upholding Turkish national sovereignty as the best course of action. With such groups, the Young Turks maintained close contact and offered the Arabs a broad autonomy to win them over. However, the reverses suffered by Turkey in the war and the narrow outlook of the Young Turks soon compelled the Arabs to rise in open rebellion in 1916. The revolting Turks were supported by Britain to further weaken the Young Turk regime.</p>
<p class="indent">Added to the activities of the Arab nationalist leaders, the Arab Sheiks and Sheriffs, governors and generals also conspired against Turkish rule. Imam Yahya of Yemen obtained from the Young Turks more autonomous powers and used to remain under the nominal Turkish rule. The Sheriff of Mecca, Hussain raised the banner of revolt. His son, Prince Abdullah made the intention of his father clear to the British that he was prepared to establish friendship with the British if they supported the independence of the Arab princes. When the Young Turks came to know of these plans, Hussain was striped off his governorship of Hejaj and a new governor was appointed. But they were very soon obliged to order this governor to make peace with Hussain. An Arab conference was held in 1913 at Mohammarah in Iran to demand the independence of Iraq. In Kuwait, another conference was held in 1914 which was attended by all the important Arab princes and the nationalist leaders. The latter were filled with burning patriotism and were in favour of a united nation state of the Arabs, while the former were only interested in promoting their claims for separate sheikdoms and principalities. This perhaps was the greatest handicap suffered by the Arab nationalists. In spite of it, World War I gave substantial stimulus to the Arab Nationalism.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was its Outcome?</b></i></span> As seen earlier, the Arabs in the Turkish Empire rose in revolt in 1916 with the help of the British under Colonel T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) and later under General Allenby. They played an important part in liberating the Arab territories from Turkish rule. As a bribe to win the Arab support against Turkey, the British made vague promises that when the war was over, the Arabs would be allowed to set up independent states. At the same time, doubtless under the pressures of war, the British had also made the contradictory Sykes&ndash;Picot agreement with France, which specified that Arab lands in Turkey would be divided between the two of them. In 1919, therefore, to their immense disappointment, the Arabs found their territories handed over as mandates (to be ‘looked after’ and prepared for self-government) to Britain (Iraq, Trans-Jordan and Palestine) and France (Syria and Lebanon).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-545" class="calibre10"></a>Britain from the beginning was reluctant to cut all connections with her mandates because of the oil resources in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq, and wanted to be allowed to station troops there to guarantee a sure source of oil. On the other hand, the British dared not to offend the Arabs too deeply or oil supplies might equally be threatened. Consequently, steady progress towards independence was made in Iraq and Trans-Jordan, though with strings attached; however, the situation in Palestine was complicated by the Jewish-Arab problem.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00113.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Sykes-Picot Agreement</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="calibre_link-546" class="calibre10"></a><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How Did the Arabs win Freedom?</b></i></span> In Iraq, after some initial nationalist rioting, the British set-up an Iraqi national government in which each minister had a British adviser. Prince Faisal, son of Sheriff Hussain of Mecca (Faisal had just been driven out of Syria by the French) was accepted as king. Although the hardcore nationalists did not approve, this new set up was approved by the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1922 and worked well. An elected Parliament was introduced in 1924 and Faisal, a man of great personal charm and political ability, proved to be an excellent ruler. With the British help, industry and agriculture were organised and an efficient administrative system was introduced. The British won Iraqi support by successfully opposing Turkish claims to the province of Mosul with its vast oil resources. In 1932, Iraq became fully independent, though Britain was allowed to keep two air bases in the country.</p>
<p class="indent">In Trans-Jordan, the British enthroned Faisal’s brother, Abdullah, as king, and allowed him to run the country’s internal affairs, which he did competently. However, Trans-Jordan was a poor state, lacking resources and with no oil, and was therefore dependent on Britain for subsidies and for defence. In 1946, it was given complete independence, though Abdullah kept employing British officers to lead his army.</p>
<p class="indent">Palestine proved to be the most troublesome mandate because of the growing hostility between Jews and Arabs. The problem originated about 2000 years earlier in 71 AD when most of the Jews were driven out of Palestine, their homeland, by the Romans. In fact, small communities of Jews remained in Palestine and over the following 1,700 years, there was a gradual trickle of Jews returning from exile. Until the end of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, their population was very less and their presence did not cause any threat to the Arabs. However, in 1897 some European Jews founded the ‘World Zionist Organisation’ at Basle in Switzerland, an event which was to be of profound importance for the Middle East.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00140.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Awakening of Arab World</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-547" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00025.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">Greatly disturbed by the recent prosecution of Jews in Russia, Germany and France the Zionists demanded a Jewish national home in Palestine. Even before they received the mandate over Palestine, the British had become involved in the controversy and must take much of the blame for the chaos that followed, especially after 1945.</p>
<p class="indent">The trouble began soon after World War I when large numbers of Jews began to settle in Palestine, a British mandate hoping to set up Jewish ‘national home’. The Arabs in Palestine were vehemently opposed to the idea of separate Jewish state in what they considered to be their <a id="calibre_link-548" class="calibre10"></a>homeland. In order to retain Arab friendship and their own oil supplies, the British limited Jewish immigration to 10,000 a year in 1939. The World War II aggravated the problem when hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees flocked to Palestine from Hitler’s Germany. In 1945, USA pressed British to admit one lakh of them into Palestine. But the British refused this demand, not wanting to offend the Arabs.</p>
<p class="indent">The Jews, after all that their race had suffered at the hands of the Nazis, were determined to fight for their ‘National home’. They began a terrorist campaign against both Arabs and British. The British responded by arresting Jewish leaders and by turning back ships crammed with intending immigrants. But the British, weakened by the war, were unable to cope up fully with the problem. So, the Foreign Secretary of Britain invited the UNO to deal with the problem. In November 1947, the UNO voted to partition Palestine, setting aside roughly half of it to form an independent Jewish state. Early in 1948, the British abandoned the mandate and withdrew their troops, though fighting was already taking place between Jews and Arabs, who strongly resented the loss of half of Palestine. In May 1948, Ben Gurion declared the state of Israel independent. It was immediately attacked by Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon.</p>
<p class="indent">Against apparently overwhelming odds, the Israelis managed to survive and captured most of Palestine. The UN played an important role in bringing the fighting to an end. Israeli success was due partly to their own desperate resistance and to the fact that the Arabs were divided amongst themselves and poorly equipped. The most tragic result of the war was the plight of the Palestinian Arabs who found themselves inside the new state of Israel. In one of the incidents, Jewish terrorists had slaughtered the entire population of an Arab village after which nearly a million Arabs fled into Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria where they lived in miserable refugee camps. Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan, and although USA, Britain and France guaranteed Israel’s frontiers, the Arab states did not regard the ceasefire as permanent; this was only the first round in the struggle to destroy Israel and liberate Palestine. Though more than four decades have passed by, the problem of Palestine is yet to be solved.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the fierce resistance of the Syrians and the Lebanese, the French occupied Syria and Lebanon which had been given to the French as mandates. Contrary to the principles governing the mandates, the French divided Syria into small states of Greater Lebanon, Alwi, Syria and Jabl-ud-Druz in order to keep them disunited. When there were nosings of introducing self-government, people rose in revolt in 1925 at Druz which gradually spread to Damascus and other cities. The rebels were successful in occupying many parts of Lebanon and Syria. Though the French were able to recapture these areas, the uprising made the French adopt a policy of compromise. A constitution was proclaimed for the Lebanese Republic in 1926. As for Syria is concerned the French announced a constituent assembly which drafted a constitution on the French pattern, but was rejected by the Syrians.</p>
<p class="indent">Serious disturbances again took place in 1936. The French yielded by more concessions, and by the Franco-Syrian compromise of 1936 the French agreed to leave Syria within three years. In the same year, Lebanon also signed a similar treaty with France. Butit was not until 1944 that France recognised the complete independence of Syria and Lebanon and, in 1946, the French troops were totally withdrawn from these areas. The Kingdom of Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud that extended all over Arabian desserts came to be known as Saudi Arabia. He was originally the ruler of Najd, but he soon expanded his kingdom by defeating Sheriff Hussain, the ruler of combined provinces of Najd and Hejaz. By the <a id="calibre_link-549" class="calibre10"></a>treaty of Jeddah (1927), the British recognised the complete independence of Ibn Saud. After this, Ibn Saud settled the boundary disputes with the neighbouring states of Iraq and Jordan by treaties of friendship. He followed a wise policy of cooperation with the British in the interests of his king’s demand to maintain status quo in the Middle East. Economically, Saudi Arabia recorded a remarkable progress under him. The discovery of oil in the land brought immense riches. He steadfastly adhered to his pro-western policy during World War II, and his unstinted cooperation with the USA helped a great deal in the consolidation of the natural resources of his country.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the fact that there was deep political chaos in the Arab states, the Nationalism was always kept alive. They maintained their own individuality amidst difficult circumstances. The old moorings were replaced by modern techniques of civilisation. Their oil resources forced the world powers to make necessary adjustments so that the oil supplies were steadily maintained in the world market. The efforts of Egypt on the one hand, and that of Saudi Arabia on the other to lead the Arabs, no doubt, caused international tensions. The Arabs always stood for realities rather than ideological impact of their civilisation.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-73"><b class="calibre9">MODERN TURKEY UNDER KEMAL</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Mustafa Kemal is held to be the founder of modern Turkey. He later came to be known as ‘Ataturk’ or the foremost Turk. His successful defence of the Dardanelles during World War I, made him very famous. After the fighting ceased, he let the opposition to the Sevres Treaty. His defiant nationalism made him unpopular with the powers in Constantinople and he was sent to Eastern Asia Minor where, it was hoped, he could not cause any trouble. But Kemal travelled extensively in the Turkish hinterland, organising resistance to the Allies and their puppet Sultan in the capital. By September 1919, Kemal summoned a nationalist congress which adopted a national pact consisting of six principles. These included self-determination, abolition of capitulation security for Constantinople and a new Straits settlement. In the October 1919 elections, Kemal’s supporters won a majority and the national pact was adopted when parliament met in January1920. Kemal made the final break by summoning his nationalist deputies to Ankara in Central Asia Minor. There on April 23,1920, they denounced the Sultan’s regime and established a provisional government with Kemal as president.</p>
<p class="indent">The nationalist triumphed over seemingly overwhelming odds, thanks to the courageous and inspired leadership of Kemal. Another factor was the loyal support of the Turkish masses who were united by the high-hand-edness of the Allies in Constantinople and even more by the landing of Greek troops in Smyrna in the spring of 1919. Kemal’s success was also due to his exploitation of the serious differences amongst the Allies to conclude separate treaties with them, there by isolating the Greeks in Smyrna and paving the way for their defeat. The Allied dissension arose from the fact that both the French and the Italians felt that the British and their Greek supporters had gotten the lion’s share of the spoils in the Middle East. Using these dissensions Kemal was able to sign separate treaties with France, Italy and Russia, leaving only Britain and Greece to enforce the Sevres Treaty.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00052.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Mustafa Kemal</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-550" class="calibre10"></a>Kemal then demanded the revision of the Sevres Treaty. After negotiations, the Lausanne Treaty signed on July 24 1923 restoring to Turkey Eastern Thrace and some of the Aegean islands. Turkey was to pay no reparations, and capitulations were abolished in return for a promise of judicial reforms. The Straits continued to be a demilitarised zone and open to ships of all nations in war and peace if Turkey remained neutral. If Turkey was at war, enemy ships, but not neutrals, might be excluded. Finally, a separate agreement provided for the compulsory exchange of the Greek minority in Eastern Thrace and Macedonia.</p>
<p class="indent">The Lausanne Treaty represented a great personal triumph for Kemal. The Ottoman Empire died after a chequered history. On October 29, 1923, the Turkish republic was formally proclaimed with Kemal as president. Having created the new Turkey, Kemal turned to the equally difficult task of creating new Turks. He swept away the outdated institutions of the past, as reform after reform followed in a continuous torrent of change.</p>
<p class="indent">By the time of Kemal’s death on November 10, 1938, the new Turkey was firmly established. The newness was, however, limited in scope. A large proportion of the peasantry, which constituted a great majority of the population, still clung to their age old Muslim customs. On the other hand, the elite ruling the country were Europeanised in their thinking and style. This gap between the elite and the peasants was to cause much trouble for Turkey after World War II.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did Kemal Rise to Power?</b></i></span> In 1919, Turkey was a vanquished power, further humiliated by the Treaty of Serves, which compelled it to hand over large areas of its territory to the Allies. This provoked a strong nationalist reaction especially among the educated classes and the army; the lead was taken by Mustafa Kemal Pasha, a young general who had made a reputation for himself as the commander who beat the British at Gallipoli in 1915. He and his supporters were determined not to accept defeat, and denouncing the Sultan and his government at Constantinople (Istanbul)as ‘prisoners of the Allies’, they put up a rival government at Ankara with Kemal as president. By September 1922, all foreign occupying troops had been removed, though the crisis at Chanak almost caused war with Britain. The Sultan fled, the monarchy was abolished, and the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) allowed Turkey more favourable terms. In October 1923, Kemal, leader of the Republican People’s Party which he had himself created, was elected first president of the Turkish Republic.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were Kemal’s Problems?</b></i></span> The problems facing the new president were many, but he seemed to have been quite successful in dealing with them. The fundamental problem was that Turkey was backward in almost every conceivable way, and though Kemal believed in democracy, the necessary reforms were so drastic that serious opposition was bound to occur. This obliged him to rule as a dictator for most of his presidency. To begin with, as soon as the drastic nature of Kemal’s proposed reforms became known, there was strong opposition both inside and outside the National Assembly (parliament), especially from Muslim clerics. A rebellion broke out in 1925, led by a conservative sheikh. Kemal swiftly suppressed it and used it as an excuse to ban all political parties except his own and to take control of the press. This enabled the first batch of reforms (between 1925 and 1928) to be carried through successfully. By 1929, Kemal was ready to relax controls and an opposition party was allowed to be formed. Unfortunately, several demonstrations organised by the new party soon became riots and Kemal decided that the experiment in democracy was premature. Hence he again banned all opposition parties. Not until 1946 were the Turks allowed another attempt at democracy. However, Kemal’s dictatorship, though strict, was not brutal or aggressive.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-551" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00079.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">Treaty of Sevres, 1920 and Treaty of Lausanne, 1923</p>
<p class="indent">Besides, the country was backward socially and legally because of the influence of Islam which pervaded all aspects of Turkish life, including education and law. Islam became a hindrance to Turkey’s development into a modern state. To bring Turkey into the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century meant an attack on the powers of Islam and the introduction of western methods and customs. In 1928, Turkey was declared a secular state, and hence forth Islam was not permitted to play any role in politics. New codes of civil and criminal law, the Roman alphabet, western calendar and the weekend were introduced; the status of women was improved by a series of laws; primary education was made free and compulsory; laws compelling the Turks to <a id="calibre_link-552" class="calibre10"></a>make changes in their dress-styles were also passed.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, Turkey’s economic backwardness was a serious obstacle to her progress. In order to overcome it, Kemal adopted a policy, known as ‘Statism’, i.e., state interference in as many areas as possible. Farmers were encouraged with government subsidies to use the latest techniques and equipment and to join co-operatives. During the great depression of the early 1930s they were directed to produce those crops which still had export potential. Consequently, peasant farmers came through the depression reasonably well. The government nationalised railways, harbours and shipping, and provided funds to expand industries such as textiles, mining, iron and steel, paper, etc. With the help of tariffs and state control of foreign exchange, Turkish industry withstood the depression better than most European countries.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did he Modernise Polity and Society?</b></i></span> Mustafa Kemal initially accepted the clause in the new Constitution of 1921, which declared the state religion to be Islam. But there was a growing conviction that radical reform would be possible only if the state is freed from religion. This clause and the position of the Sultan were accordingly the first targets of attack. On March 3, 1924, the Grand National Assembly passed laws expelling the Ottoman dynasty; abolishing the Caliphate, the Commissariats of Sharia (the office for the religious affairs) and the <i class="calibre8">Waqf</i> (pious foundations); and attaching the ‘madrasahs’ (religious colleges and schools) to the Commissariat of Public Instruction. By these laws the Turkish republic put an end to Pan-Islamism in Turkey. The most important step in secularisation was the clause of one of the three laws which withdrew the ‘civil transaction’ section of the Sharia, which so far had dominated the Turkish code. The dispatch of all cases which related to dogma and religion passed to an office, called the ‘Presidency of Religious Affairs’. Thus, for the first time, Turkey tried to separate religion from the state. A new constitution which was democratic inform was adopted on 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> April 1924. Although constitutionally, the national sovereignty was in the hands of the national assembly, Kemal, through his personal prestige and through his hold over the army, showed inclination towards a personal dictatorship. This created a lot of opposition to his rule. So when the Kurdish provinces rebelled, Kemal used it as pretext to strike at the opposition. For this purpose, he had the ‘Law of Maintenance of Order’ passed by the National Assembly.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, after putting down all opposition to his rule, Kemal again went ahead with his programme of secularisation and modernisation of polity and society. The religious orders were abolished and the monasteries were closed as having influenced the Kurdish rising. A decree ordered the army to adopt a ‘kepi’ and civil servants to wear hats. A law passed in November 1925 abolished the ‘fez’ and obliged everybody (only males) to wear hats. On February 17, 1926, the National Assembly adopted a civil code which was almost a translation of the Swiss code, and this is the most fundamental of his recent reforms. By the adoption of this code, Turkish legislation was wholly freed from Islamic influence. The laws concerning marriage, divorce and inheritance, which had been totally different from those of the West, were altered, and polygamy was legally prohibited. This radical secularisation led the non-Muslim minorities to voluntarily renounce the minority rights which they had procured at the Lausanne Conference. The secular republic had now only two points of contact left with religion; the clause in the constitution which stated that the religion of the state was Islam, and the law which attached the residency of religious affairs to the prime minister’s office. The former was, however, broken on 9<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> April, 1928 by amendment to the constitution.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-553" class="calibre10"></a>The radical legislative measures between 1925 and 1928 had completely changed the whole life of Turkey. Instead of the medieval oriental Ottoman Empire, a modern secular republic had emerged. Its basis was no longer the religion of Islam with its medieval canon law but a progressive Turkish nationalism trying to adapt itself to western society and to national democratic forms of life. Though the process of transformation demanded the strong hand of an enlightened dictatorship, Turkey retained a strictly democratic parliamentarian constitution, and the greatest care was taken to educate the people in the principles of democracy. Thus, the dictatorship in Turkey was fundamentally different from contemporary fascist or communist dictatorships. Its aim was the progressive education of the backward, illiterate peasant population towards liberalism and modern concepts of society.</p>
<p class="indent">The educational system was thoroughly secularised, and special importance was given to technical and professional education. Great efforts were made to arouse the understanding of conditions of modern life and to awaken the sense of initiative. The appearance of the town people was completely changed by the abandonment of the oriental dress and headgear. The Turkish language was modernised and liberated from its medieval dependence upon Arabic and Persian. Women received complete equality with men, not only in theory but also in political and social life. To signify the liberation of women in Turkey, the 12<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> International Women’s Conference was held at Istanbul in April 1935. On 6<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> December, 1934, the Grand National Assembly (called ‘Kamutay’ in Turkish language) changed the constitution so that all Turkish women and men were hence forth entitled to vote in legislative elections as soon as they had reached the age of 23 and to become elected at the age of 31. Sunday, instead of Friday, was introduced in 1935 as the weekly rest day. All the old Turkish titles (like Pasha) were abolished, and family names were introduced after western patterns. Mustafa Kemal received the name, Kemal ‘Ataturk’.</p>
<p class="indent">The democratic character of the new constitution is expressed in its fundamental articles, according to which not only all civic liberties and individual rights are guaranteed but also all legislative power is exclusively in the hands of the elected assembly. The assembly also exercises executive power, because the president of the republic is elected by it and, according to the amendment of 6<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> December 1934, from among the deputies, his term of office being identical with the life of each assembly. On February 5<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> 1937, the national assembly accepted the six principles of the Republican People’s Party Republicanism; Nationalism; Democracy; Evolutionism; separation of state and religion; and state supervision of the principal industries, public utility services and means of communication.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did he Modernise the Economy?</b></i></span> Secularisation of the polity and society was not enough to make Turkey a modernised and strong nation. Modernisation of the economy which was quite backward compared to the economies of contemporary European counties was equally important.</p>
<p class="indent">So, Kemal gave equal attention to the economic rehabilitation of the country, the intensification and diversification of agriculture, and the introduction of modern industries. As is the case with most of the underdeveloped countries, the main occupation in Turkey was agriculture. But before Kemal came to power, the methods of agriculture were quite redundant and the area under cultivation was very small compared to the total area of Turkey.</p>
<p class="indent">So, a series of measures were undertaken to improve the methods of cultivation and extend the area under cultivation. In 1925 zones of development with directors of agriculture were formed for the development of the country. The <a id="calibre_link-554" class="calibre10"></a>Agricultural Bank was established on a state controlled footing in order to facilitate loans to local groups and individuals. Further, agricultural schools were also established to provide free instruction to the agriculturists. In all some 300,000 refugees from the old provinces of Turkey in Europe were settled in Turkey proper, and all the ‘tithe’ (a kind of tax) payments were abolished as an incentive to the peasants. The latter reform came into effect in February 1925, and in its place a system of land taxation was fixed, based on the production instead of on the area of the soil. In 1937, a four-year-agricultural plan was formulated, wherein a significant sum was set aside to facilitate important irrigation schemes and the more intensive cultivation of cotton and tobacco (the most important agricultural products of Turkey).Throughout the country, agricultural experts were appointed to supervise and help introduce modern methods of agriculture. Model farms were established and special emphasis was laid upon agricultural education. As a result of the introduction of all these measures, agricultural output in Turkey increased significantly.</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, an industrialisation programme was also inaugurated. This was to be achieved with minimum dependence on foreign help. But the necessary foreign exchange was not forthcoming to meet the needs. So, the government introduced stiff measures to control the exchange rates, and thus, regulate exports and imports. When there was a steep fall in the Turkish exports due to the world depression, the government tried to overcome the problem by directing the farmers to concentrate on the production of only those products which were still exportable and also by entering into trade agreement with Germany. In order to accelerate the pace of industrial growth, the government inaugurated a five year plan in 1933.The government took over the operation of railways, harbours and shipping, besides acquiring the monopoly of several industries like paper, iron and steel, mining, textiles, etc. The state-owned industries were to be assisted by the Bank of Affairs. The newly created Sumner Bank was to manage them. The Eti Bank was set up in 1936 to develop mineral and metal industry. Finally, Turkey entered into trade agreements with Germany, Italy the USA and the Balkan states, which in turn greatly helped in its economic development.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What was his Foreign Policy?</b></i></span> Kemal Ataturk carefully shaped the foreign policy of Turkey as well. He followed a cautious policy which was characterised by neither isolation nor aggression. It was a policy of self-defence and self-interest. The Laussane Conference had left the question of Mosul (the oil rich area between Turkey and Iraq) and the issue of the Straits unsettled. The Republic was keen to see that these two problems are settled amicably so that normal relations are established with neighbouring states.</p>
<p class="indent">With regard to the Mosul question, the representatives of Britain and Turkey met at Constantinople in May 1924. The Turkish delegates argued that Britain could not claim Mosul, for it had been promised to France in the secret treaties that were concluded among the Allies to partition the ‘sick man’ during the World War I. Britain did not accept this contention of Turkey. So, the matter was referred to the League Council in September 1924. The League Council recognised the Brussels line as the frontier between Iraq and Turkey. It also appointed a commission to examine the question and submit a report. Accordingly the commission recommended in its report of 1925 to unite Mosul with Iraq, and Britain was to be given mandate over it for 25 years. Turkey did not accept this report. The matter was, therefore, referred to the International Court of Justice, which, however, referred it back to the League. Turkey did not accept the decision of the League which awarded Mosul to Britain. The Mosul question made the Turks to regard <a id="calibre_link-555" class="calibre10"></a>Britain as their permanent enemy. However, in 1926, Turkey also felt that the question of Mosul should be settled once for all by offering a proposal in which Turkey conceded the earlier decision of the League (to award Mosul to Iraq), provided Iraq paid a 10% royalty on oil rights of Mosul or a lump- sum of 5 lakh pounds in full settlement of the claims for ever. Britain (which still ruled Iraq) agreed to pay the lumpsum, and the issue was closed. This settlement was followed by the conclusion of a treaty of commerce and navigation on the basis of the most favoured nation clause in 1930.</p>
<p class="indent">Coming to the issue of the Straits, Turkey was very eager to settle the issue, because the Straits of Bosphorus and Dardanelles were strategically very important for it. The demilitarisation of this zone always presented a threat to Turkey. Even the Russian interests in the Black Sea were insecure. So, Russia and Turkey concluded a treaty in Paris in December 1925 to protect their mutual interests. This treaty, however, did not prevent Turkey from adopting an independent foreign policy. In fact, a treaty of friendship was signed with Italy in 1928.This helped in the development of Italian trade in the Straits zone.</p>
<p class="indent">Turkey maintained very friendly relations with the Balkan states also. The six states (Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Turkey and Yugoslavia) met at Athens in 1930, at Istanbul in 1931, at Bucharest in 1932, and at the Salonika in 1933. In these conferences, Turkey impressed the delegates on the importance of collective security and economic cooperation. They were also to develop a joint chamber of commerce, agriculture and industries, medical union and also a commission of jurists to bring about uniform law codes and the Balkan postal union. This farsighted policy of Kemal gave the Balkan states economic progress and political stability to a great event. Turkey under Kemal came to be regard by the Balkans as a model for them.</p>
<p class="indent">To wipe off the legacies of the Lausanne Treaty, Kemal called for a conference of the signatories at the Lausanne Conference to be convened on 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> July 1936 at Montreaux. Turkey insisted that the signatories (France, Britain, USSR, Japan, Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia) should revise the treaty. So, the treaty was revised, giving freedom of navigation in the Straits to maritime vessels in peace time. Turkey was authorised to inspect the merchant ships even in war time if Turkey was a neutral power. When Turkey was a party in the war, the merchant ships of only neutral powers could enjoy passage in day time, and the passage of all war ships was left to the discretion of Turkey. The functions of the International Straits Commission were transferred to the Turkish government, which meant recognition of the full sovereign rights of Turkey over the Straits.</p>
<p class="indent">Turkey was admitted into the League of Nations in July 1932, and she began to play an active role when elected to the League Council in 1934. In this way, Kemal Ataturk enhanced the prestige of Turkey on the international scene. Thus, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was not only responsible for the country’s progressive domestic policy, but also for a most successful foreign policy by which Turkey became the cornerstone of a peaceful system in the Near East.</p>

<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Portuguese merchants were the first Europeans to arrive in the East Indies. The Dutch followed the Portuguese. The Dutch East India Company which was initially carrying on trade after 1750, found the local political situation favourable for setting up their government. However, they did not establish direct rule. When the Dutch East India Company’s fortunes <a id="calibre_link-556" class="calibre10"></a>suffered a serious setback, the Netherlands government stepped into the possessions of the company in 1798. Thus the Dutch Colonialism was confirmed in the East Indies. Therefore, the island came to be known as the Dutch Indies. Though the British also held the islands for a short while during the Napoleonic wars, they were restored back to the Dutch again after the Congress of Vienna.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the Dutch the resources of the islands were exploited for the advantage of the Dutch throughout the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. In the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, the Dutch apprehended other foreign influences in these islands. Therefore, they gradually spread their control all over. The Dutch created a centralised administration under a Governor-General and the different provinces were administered by the Governors subordinate to him. Batavia (Jakarta) was created of the imperial government. The Governor-General was directly responsible to the Government of Holland (Netherlands).</p>
<p class="indent">These developments aroused the national sentiments of the Indonesians. The earliest of the national organisations was the ‘Boedi Octomo’, the Glorious Endeavour. Its first congress was convened in 1908.The main objective of this organisation was to achieve economic and educational progress. The next major political organisation was Sarekat Islam. It was composed of Muslims. The initial programme of this society was to achieve economic independence by excluding Chinese trade monopolies. However, politically it aimed at the establishment of an Islamic state. Its first convention was held in 1913.Soon the Sarekat Islam became a powerful organ and gradually attracted the trade unions also into its fold. The Indonesian Communist Party was another important political force which began to operate against the Dutch rule. It was founded in 1920. The programme of the Indonesian Communist Party was to establish a secular state. The Nationalist Party founded in 1927 followed a more liberal policy and aimed at the establishment of a free Republic. It was led by Sukarno. These organisations trained young men for political activity. But it did not gain momentum as it was not organised as a mass movement. Only the intelligentsia was attracted and not the masses and the laymen.</p>
<p class="indent">In spite of the fact that the Indonesian national movement was not mass oriented, it did attract the attention of the Dutch. There were political disturbances organised by the communists. Though the communist insurrections were later on suppressed, the Dutch had to introduce certain reforms to weaken the growth of vigorous Nationalism. Accordingly, they announced a policy of gradual introduction of self-government and associating the Indonesian intelligentsia in the administration. After 1927 when the communist uprisings were enacted, national societies were suppressed. Nationalist leaders like Achmed Sukarno and Mohammed Hatta were imprisoned. However, after1930, the nationalists followed a policy of cooperation and entered the legislatures.</p>
<p class="indent">Though the Dutch were not prepared to concede independence, there had been a proposal to grant self-government. But such ideas remained only on paper for, after 1941, the international situation was tense due to the outbreak of the World War II. Japan invaded Indonesia in 1941 and completed the occupation of the islands by 1942. This marked the end of Dutch Colonialism. They obtained the support of a section of the nationalists. Anti-Dutch feelings developed among the Indonesians. They were led to believe that the end of the Dutch rule would bring them political freedom if they collaborated with the Japanese. It is needless to point out that the Japanese exploited the resources of Indonesia and caused further deterioration in the Indonesian economy. Politically, the Japanese occupation enabled the Indonesians to declare their independence. Sukarno and Mohammed Hatta joined the Japanese invaders. They declared the independence of Indonesia on 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> <a id="calibre_link-557" class="calibre10"></a>August 1945 while the Japanese were still in occupation. The late arrival of the Allied troops after the surrender of Japan helped the nationalists to consolidate their authority and set up a stable government.</p>
<p class="indent">These circumstances forced the Dutch to reach a political settlement with the Indonesian Republic. The Indonesian Republic was formally recognised by the Dutch when the ‘Linggadjati’ agreement was signed on 15<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> November, 1946. The <i class="calibre8">de facto</i> sovereignty of Indonesia over Java, Madra and Sumatra was recognised.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Factors Responsible for the Rise of Indonesian Nationalism?</b></i></span> The Dutch, like any other imperialist power, was primarily concerned with the economic exploitation of their colony in the Indies. The land was very fertile and rich in mineral resources. The land legislation and other measures in connection with the Culture System, the Liberal Policy and later the Ethical Policy resulted in the extension of cultivation, but in no way improved their standards of living. Instead it tied them more to the land and prevented any economic initiative on the part of the Indonesians. Consequently, the European capital, mainly the Dutch capital, controlled the Indonesian economy. Except the members of the aristocracy, other native Indonesians had to earn their livelihood mostly as peasants and occasionally as workers.</p>
<p class="indent">The feeling of Nationalism also spread due to the introduction of western education and thought. From the study of the western history the people of South-East Asia, including Indonesia, came to know about Britain’s constitutional struggles, the patriotic and heroic fight for independence by the American colonies and the French Revolution which propagated the ideas of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. These aroused their spirit of Patriotism and filled their hearts with ardent desire for independence. The study of modern liberalism also made them conscious about their rights and privileges and they began to feel keenly the humiliations of racial discrimination practiced by their western rulers. The young men of these countries saw that even after they had received western education, they were treated as inferiors and were not given higher posts in the government. So they felt strongly against their foreign rulers. The invention of new and better means of transport like the steam ship and the railway and the opening of the Suez Canal made communications between the East and the West easier and quicker. The benefits of modern science which the western rulers had brought with them, the press, the telegraph, the railways, etc., also aided the process of Nationalism. Literacy rate was higher in the urban areas and the benefits of modern science and technology were first felt here. The spirit of Nationalism and anti-imperialism naturally developed first in the urban areas. The political consciousness, however, was confined to the newly emerging intelligentsia from whom the political agitators and eventually the national leaders emerged.</p>
<p class="indent">The intelligentsia was frustrated and they took solace in reconstructing their past greatness. It must be admitted that in constructing the ancient history of these countries, the western scholars, historians and archaeologists played a major role. But once the intelligentsia of these countries became aware of their past greatness, they wanted to be the worthy inheritors of their ancient forefathers. This was also a driving force in the nationalist and anti-imperialist movements.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, India and China with their nationalist aspirations and agitations influenced their neighbours in this region. The nationalist movement which started in India in the last quarter of the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century and which assumed gigantic proportions in the first half of the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century was a source of great inspiration to the countries of South-East Asia. The anti-imperialist and nationalist movement in China was also watched with interest and the <a id="calibre_link-558" class="calibre10"></a>successful revolution of 1911 in China had a deep impact on other Asians.</p>
<p class="indent">The Russo-Japanese War of 1905 had great influence upon the nationalist movements throughout East Asia. The victory of an oriental nation over a great European power released forces of anti-westernism and Nationalism in Asia which had long been seething under the surface. This shattered the myth of western invincibility, and the inhabitants of South Asia felt that they could also emulate the feat of Japan.</p>
<p class="indent">The World War I enabled the nations of the East to play a part in the defeat of the Central Powers by the Allies and to achieve their own demands during and after the war. The main aim of the war, the Allies declared, was to champion the principle of self-determination of nations and to make the world safe for democracy. It sounded remarkably appropriate to Asians who had been for a long time exploited by the imperialist powers of the West. All these fostered the growth of Nationalism and led the people of colonial South-East Asia to expect a greater degree of independence and equal treatment. But at the end of the war, the nationalists of South-East Asia realised that the imperialist powers had no desire to fulfill the pledges that they had given during the crisis of the war. This frustration and consequent revulsion against white exploitation and control engendered a sense of unity among the people of the area and strengthened the nationalist movements there.</p>
<p class="indent">The Indonesian nationalists felt that they were exploited by the Dutch more harshly than any other people in the East. They resented the strict Paternalism exercised over them. They were anxious to receive higher education and reduce illiteracy. They were legitimately aggrieved at the policy of imposing heavy taxes on the native rubber planters so that they might not compete favourably with the Europeans. These grievances, together with the above resentments and influences, gave rise to the Indonesian Nationalist Movement in the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did the Movement Rise and Grow?</b></i></span> The first nationalist organisation in Indonesia, “Boedi Octomo” (Glorious Endeavour), was established in 1908 by Dr. Waidin Sudira Usada, a retired medical officer. Although some racial elements and intellectuals entered this organisation, its members were mainly retired Javanese officials who were moderate in their aims, and chiefly fought for educational reforms.</p>
<p class="indent">Sarekat Islam was established in 1912 and worked to resist the stronghold of the Chinese merchants on the rural economy; a genuine nationalist and anti-imperialist movement had begun. As early as 1914, Sarekat Islam declared that its objective was complete political independence. Its emphasis on economic progress as a socio-religious necessity for Indonesia was popular, and by 1916, its membership rose above 3,60,000. The double character, national and religious nature of the organisation, attracted the attention of the Dutch and made them anxious about the future of the colony. Sarekat Islam, because of its religious character apart from its nationalistic character, was able to attract many Indonesians, who were predominantly Muslim, into its fold. Thus, Sarekat Islam not only fought for political and economic reforms, but also tried to introduce reforms in Islam. However, this religious character of Sarekat Islam made some progressive people suspicious of its objectives, and this was in fact responsible for its decline.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the Dutch neutrality in the World War I, Indonesia was not directly involved in it. However, Indonesian Nationalism and Radicalism received great impetus from the general anti- colonial propaganda as well as from the Russian Revolution of1971.The creation of a “Volksraad” (People’s Council), a sham parliament, in 1918 didn’t satisfy the Indonesian nationalists.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-559" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00106.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">In 1919, with the foundation of the “Partai Kommunis India” (PKI), organised radical Socialism made its appearance in the country. So, a struggle for leadership of the freedom movement now began between the PKI and the Sarekat Islam, which had established relations with the Indian National Congress and adopted its policy of non-cooperation. The years 1923&ndash;26 saw a series of revolutionary outbreaks in western Java and Sumatra organised by PKI. The Dutch repressed the outbreaks with brutal force and banned the PKI, which left Sarekat Islam as the main organ of Nationalism. However, by this time a host of other political parties also had come into existence.</p>
<p class="indent">Anti-Dutch Nationalism in the early twenties found expression in the so-called ‘wild schools’ set up by the nationalist groups which operated outside the government control. In the mid-twenties, the same group of intellectuals established ‘study clubs’ to discuss social, economic and political questions. There emerged new political parties out of these study clubs, the most important among them being the ‘Partai National Indonesia’ (PNI) established in 1927 from the Bandung study club. Its leaders were Djipto Mangun Kusuma and the rising young engineer demagogue, Sukarno. The main aims of this party were the attainment of political independence through non-cooperation movement and establishment of a democratic form of government. It soon became the leading nationalist party in the country. Alarmed by its rapid growth, the Dutch authority tried to suppress it. The suppression of the PNI and the imprisonment of Sukarno in 1927 merely increased the determination of the Indonesians to become free from any type of foreign control. The Dutch endeavoured to win over a section of the people by broadening and decentralising their colonial administration. The Volksraad was given some legislative power. The Governor-General, however, retained the authority of vetoing any legislation and to issue ordinances. The right to vote was also kept very limited. These measures naturally failed to meet the nationalist demands.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus the continued refusal to consider the establishment of some form of real representative institutions which would ultimately lead towards self-government frustrated the Indonesians and made them only more determined and insistent in their demands. It also united Indonesians, and finally in 1939, various <a id="calibre_link-560" class="calibre10"></a>nationalist groups were united by Sukarno into a federation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Developments during and after World War II?</b></i></span> The Dutch empire in the East was, however, destroyed in 1941&ndash;42, not by the power of native Nationalism but by a Japanese naval and military invasion. During the World War II, the Japanese talked about a ‘Greater East Asia’, but were not inclined to give real independence to Indonesia. When it became clear, they quietly began preparations for Indonesian independence. Just before surrender on August 17, 1945, the Japanese permitted the Indonesians to proclaim the establishment of an independent republic and handed over administrative functions and arms to the new government. When a British occupation force landed in Indonesia, the Republic of Indonesia was already six weeks old and later the British occupation force gave <i class="calibre8">de facto</i> recognition to the Indonesian Republic. The Dutch also sent their force, but when they attempted to resume control, the Indonesians put up a stiff resistance. After a bitter struggle in which they suffered heavy casualties, the Dutch signed the Linggadjati Agreement in November 1946.</p>
<p class="indent">The two sides accused each other of bad faith and the Dutch in July 1947 resorted to military action which they described as ‘Police Action’. The United Nations took up the Indonesian question at the request of India and Australia and ordered ceasefire. Both the parties accepted the order, however, did not end the fighting completely. In December 1948, the Dutch again resorted to ‘Police Action’. The Republican army was defeated and the leading members of the Republican Government were captured and imprisoned. The world opinion was roused against the Dutch action. The United Nations once again intervened and ordered ceasefire. At the same time, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India convened an Asian Conference in New Delhi to consider united action in support of the Indonesians. Bowing to the world opinion, the Dutch released the imprisoned Indonesian leaders and consented to a round table conference to discuss various questions regarding the independence of the <a id="calibre_link-561" class="calibre10"></a>islands. The Conference in Hague in 1949 finally settled the matter by granting independence to Indonesia.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-75"><b class="calibre9">NATIONALIST MOVEMENT IN VIETNAM (INDO-CHINA)</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The earliest western contacts of Indo-China may be traced to the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century when the Portuguese traders entered the region. As usual, trade was followed by the Jesuit missionaries in search of new followers. The Portuguese were followed by the French in the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. The French opened diplomatic relations with different states in Indo-China to secure a foothold in order to spread their factories and compete with the Dutch and the British traders. Accordingly, in 1787 France and the King of Cochin-China signed a commercial treaty. Thereafter, the French trade and missionary activity spread into Cochin-China. This was resisted both by the native rulers as well as the people in the 19<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. It was followed by French naval attack on Annam in 1858.</p>
<p class="indent">As a result of this naval expedition, France acquired Saigon in 1859 which was formally ceded by Annam along with France agreeing to guarantee religious toleration and opening three ports for the French and Spanish trade. Soon Cambodia became a protectorate of the French. Later on other provinces were also brought under the French control. It may be noted that Indo-China comprised of five political divisions. They were Cochin-China, a possession of the French, Tonkin, Annam, Laos and Cambodia, which formed the French protectorates in the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century. They correspond to the present day independent states of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. After having established mastery over Indo-China, France interfered with the Siamese possessions to the east of Mekong. By taking away these areas from Siam, Laos and Cambodia were made French protectorates by 1907.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike the other Europeans in Asia, the French aimed at the establishment of close political relations as though the colony was an integral part of France. The local administration of the French possessions was subordinate to the Home Government. The Governor-General and his councils were just nominal bodies. However, in the protectorates, the four provinces, the native officials administered the territories under the supervision of the French officials. The people of Indo-China did not submit without offering any resistance to the French imperialism. Their national sentiments were always active. The cultural, racial and linguistic divergence of the population affected their solidarity to a great extent.</p>
<p class="indent">French people were always cautious in their administration not to awaken Nationalism among their subjects. The Patriotism of the nation was engendered by the very political ideals and institutions of the French. Further, the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War made the intellectuals in Indo-China realise their humiliating position under the French. They were seriously affected when the French employed the Indo-Chinese for forced labour during the World War I, in Europe. At the same time, the commercial interests of the Chinese in Indo-China were also considered to be disadvantageous by the nationalists. There was an anti-Chinese movement in 1919 and 1920 when the communist movement developed vigorously. The nationalism in Indo-China suffered a setback in the initial stages itself. It was due to the racial distinction that was always maintained by the Annamese. They generally regarded the people of the Laos and Cambodia as inferior. Above all, the Annamese nationalists were not united and lacked a common programme. It helped the French in suppressing the national movement in Indo-China before the World War II.</p>
<p class="indent">During the World War II, Colonialism in Indo-China was terribly shaken by the Japanese <a id="calibre_link-562" class="calibre10"></a>invasions. By 1940, France suffered a disastrous defeat in Europe. It affected the colonial government in Indo-China. All the efforts to obtain help from America proved futile. As such all the resources of Indo-China had to be placed at the disposal of Japan. Under the Japanese supervision, Bao Dai united Tonkin and Annam. He declared the independence of the empire of Annam renaming it as Vietnam. Similarly, the king Cambodia and Luang Prabang in Laos declared their independence. Bao Dai inspired the nationalists by giving the empire its old name and Ngo Dinh Diem, who held office as premier under the French but laid down the same, also joined him against the Japanese and the French. They were not supported by other nationalists and revolutionaries. By 1941, the Vietnam Independence League (Vietminh) was founded in South China by the Vietnamese revolutionaries and communists. It was headed by Ho Chi Minh, a leading communist. Chiang Kai Shek’s government encouraged their activities on the Chinese mainland against Japan. The work of Ho Chi Minh was remarkable during this period. With the help of the Allis, Ho Chi Minh was able to mobilise the Vietnamese resistance against the Japanese. Under his leadership, the Vietminh obtained a definite programme aiming at the establishment of a republican constitution which guaranteed democratic rights and privileges and promoted the national economy and welfare of the people. The events in the Pacific forced Japan to surrender in August 1945. In the same year, the national congress was convened by the Vietminh in Tonkin. It elected Ho Chi Minh as president. Bao Dai renounced his throne and accepted the office of the supreme political adviser of the provincial government of Ho Chi Minh. By constituting Annam, Tonkin and Cochin-China into a Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh declared its independence on 2 September 1945 at Hanoi.</p>
<p class="indent">The French began a political campaign against Ho Chi Minh and brainwashed Bao Dai and his supporters. Due to French pressure, the supporters of Bao Dai group proclaimed the new provisional Central Government of Annam. The French recognised the new regime by signing an agreement on 5 June 1948. The Bao Dai government came to be described as Vietnam and that of Ho Chi Minh as Vietminh. The issue assumed an international dimension, because the French, Vietnamese and Cambodians sought the help of different powers in solving the question. It also involved ideological forces. The United States supported anti-communist forces in South Vietnam and the Soviet Union tried to influence the Vietminh.</p>
<p class="indent">When the hostilities were mounting and human blood was split indiscriminately in Indo-China, an international conference met at Geneva on 26 April, 1954. When the conference ended in July 1954, series of agreements and declarations were recorded to end hostilities in Indo-China. Among them the agreement regarding a simultaneous ceasefire temporary demarcation line above the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> parallel and withdrawal of French troops were important. For the cessation of hostilities in Laos and Cambodia separate treaties were concluded. The ceasefire was to be supervised by an international commission consisting of India, Poland and Canada. Thus the unification of North and South Vietnam was marred and the different international power blocks contributed for this division. It was only in 1973 that the two could be united.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were the Causes for the Movement?</b></i></span> Divergence of race and culture of the people of Indo-China meant that nationalism struggled in an inextricable tangle of minorities or race, language and religion. Besides, the movement in Indo-China remained mainly confined to the Annamites (Vietnamese) who had a long tradition of struggling for independence against China. The Annamites during their nationalist struggle fought as much against the French political control as against the Chinese economic domination.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-563" class="calibre10"></a>The economic grievance of the Indo-Chinese against the French imperialists is the most important cause. There is no doubt that the French improved the communication system of the country and extended the complex canal system in Tonkin. As a result, the area under cultivation increased considerably. The Vietnamese peasants suffered from usurious interest rates and were generally in debt to the Chinese middlemen, who in turn were protected and supported by the French through their courts and the police. The land in the Mekong delta (South Indo-China) was owned largely by the landlords and worked by the tenants. Thus, indebtedness of the peasantry in the north and the estate system of the south created an agrarian unrest. The country is rich in minerals but the industries which extracted them were in French hands. The French-owned mining concerns were given many facilities. Indo-China was also treated as a protected market for industrial exports from France. This organised exploitation of the country by the imperial French rulers raised protest from the nationalist agitators.</p>
<p class="indent">The ideas of the French Revolution of 1789 Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity provided the ideological basis for the growth of Indo-Chinese Nationalism. The victory of Japan in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904&ndash;05 showed that an Asiatic country was capable of modern development and gave impetus to the nationalist movement. The years following 1905 came to be known as the ‘era of plots’ in which a number of local uprisings directed against the French control were put down with a heavy hand. The reform movement in China had its impact on the Vietnamese young men. Influenced by the writings of Kang Yu Wei and Liang Chi Chao, who advocated the study of western culture, they turned to the study of European philosophical writers such as Montesquieu and Rousseau. The young intellectuals flocked to the University of Hanoi when it was founded in 1907. In the very next year, it was closed as a reaction against anti-French uprisings.</p>
<p class="indent">The harsh French treatment towards the Emperor of Annam (whom they compelled to abdicate), the French policy of assimilation, and the successful Chinese Revolution of 1911 further stimulated the spirit of Nationalism. After the World War I, Indo-Chinese had been stirred by the doctrine of self-determination proclaimed by the victorious Allies. The Indian independence movement also had inspired many nationalists.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did the Movement Rise and Grow?</b></i></span> Immediately after the World War I, some moderate political parties were founded. Most of them advocated reform along democratic lines. But the French government turned down all requests of even mild reform. This discredited the moderates, and the extremists came into the scene. In 1925, the Revolutionary Party of Young Annam was founded. But due to the mutual jealousies of its leaders, the party could not make much headway. Another party, Vietnam Quoc Zah Dong rose to prominence in 1928&ndash;29. In February, 1930, this party launched an armed insurrection, but it was put down with a heavy hand. In 1930, Than Nien, or the Indo-Chinese Communist Party, was founded by Ho Chi Minh. With the appearance of Than Nien, workers’ and peasants’ movements took a new dimension. The World Economic Depression of 1930 affected Indo-China as well. It caused further deterioration to the already appalling living conditions of the masses. The rising discontent found expression in big strikes and peasant demonstrations under the leadership of the Communist Party.</p>
<p class="indent">The French called the year 1930 the ‘Year of Red Terror’ when a series of violent outbreaks directed against the French shook the country. The French suppressed the uprisings with tremendous ferocity. The movement subsided and the Indo-Chinese communists were forced to go underground. Ho Chi Minh fled to Hong <a id="calibre_link-564" class="calibre10"></a>Kong where he was kept imprisoned for three years.</p>
<p class="indent">The movement subsided in 1931, but by 1935, it surged up again. Under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh from abroad, the Indo-Chinese Communist Party maintained its clandestine network and continued its activities defying all attempts made by the French to extirpate it. The communists pursued a policy of united front and organised an Indo-Chinese Congress in 1936 that adopted a four-point programme for the establishment of a democratic front. While the French were able to destroy the moderate organisations, they could o n l y c u r b t h e communists. Thus, only the communists remained as an effective force to lead the nationalist agitation against the French imperialist rulers.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1941, Ho Chi Minh returned home to take over the leadership of the revolutionary movement. The revolutionaries organised their base in Viet Bac, and in 1941, the Independence League of Vietnam, better known as ‘Vietminh’ was founded. The French debacle in 1940 against Germany gave Japan an open control in Indo-China. The French remained as the sovereign power nominally in the country, but the real authority was enjoyed by Tokyo during the rest of the World War II. The revolutionaries, who struck both at the Japanese invaders and the French rulers, received generous Chinese, free French and American assistance of arms and ammunitions. They were mainly composed of the communist groups. The Japanese at first did not interfere with the French, and suppressed the anti-imperialist and nationalist movement in Indo China. But in the closing months of the war when the Americans were vigorously pushing forward in the Pacific, the Japanese on March1, 1945 declared the whole country, except Laos and Cambodia, to be independent. Bao Dai, the Emperor of Annam, became the emperor of the newly created state of Vietnam comprising Tonkin, Annamand Cochin-China. The new government of Bao Dai did not receive much popular support. Realising the situation, he abdicated shortly after the surrender of the Japanese. And on September 2, 1945 the Vietminh organised a provincial government with Ho Chi Minh as its president. It declared independence and the establishment of Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In the Potsdam Conference it had been decided that the surrender of the Japanese troops in Indo-China should be accepted by the Chinese troops north of the 16<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> parallel, while the British troops should accept it to the south of it. The French tried to stage a comeback in Indo-China with active British assistance. But Chiang Kai Shek’s nationalists were not at all enthusiastic about restoring the French rule in Vietnam. As a result, the French had to conclude an agreement with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 6, 1946 by which the French recognised it as a ‘free state’. But the French had no intention of keeping their words and soon conflict started. This war between the French and the Vietnamese beginning in 1946 continued unabated for eight years.</p>
<p class="indent">France, weakened by the World War II, was not able to continue the war on its own. She, however, found an ally in the USA, which offered her generous assistance. Thus, in the name of combating communism, the US intervention in Vietnam started. However, soon, realising the gravity of the situation, France agreed to sit at the round table to effect a compromise. Offers of negotiation, initiated by the Chinese and the Russians, led to the Geneva Conference of 1954. The Geneva Settlement brought provisional division of Vietnam along <a id="calibre_link-565" class="calibre10"></a>the 17<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> parallel. The northern half of the country was to remain in the possession of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRVN), while the southern half would remain in the hands of Bao Dai’s government supported by the French. It was also decided that general election in the whole of the country would be held before July 1956 that would bring about the unity of Vietnam.</p>
<p class="indent">Laos and Cambodia were neutralised and received full independence. An international commission composed of India, Canada and Poland with India as Chairman was appointed to supervise the armistice. After the Geneva Agreement, in an effort to create a strong South Vietnam as a bulwark against Communism, the USA backed ‘Ngo Dinh Diem Regime’ to strengthen South Vietnamese government. While North Vietnam, under the inspiring leadership of Ho Chi Minh made steady progress in all directions, factional struggle for power continued in South Vietnam. Soon it became clear that in any impartial general election, Ho Chi Minh’s Vietminh would obtain great success. With the USA’s support, the Diem regime refused to participate in any general election in 1956, which had been, in fact, agreed upon in the Geneva Conference. This non-implementation of the Geneva Agreement ended all hopes of peaceful solution of Vietnam tangle.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did USA Intervene?</b></i></span> The USA soon realised that in spite of generous assistance given by her, the non-communist government in South Vietnam would not be able to check the pressure of the Vietminh and the Vietcong (the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam formed in 1961). So, she did not hesitate to take more active part in Vietnam. US direct military involvement in South Vietnam started with the arrival of US military advisers in 1963 and soon the number of American troops increased to 6 lac soldiers. From the beginning the American public opinion was very much against US involvement in Vietnam and by the late 60’s it was too much for the US government to withstand. After prolonged negotiations for several years, agreement was at last reached on Vietnam issue in January 1973, and a treaty was concluded. The major clauses of the agreement were an internationally supervised ceasefire, withdrawal of all military forces from South Vietnam, etc. Soon after this agreement, the US backed government of South Vietnam was overthrown by its own people and the two Vietnams, North and South, were united. Thus, the glorious fight of the Vietnamese against foreign dominations and intervention was crowned with success. Heroic struggle of the Vietnamese against heavy odds, their sacrifices, their indomitable spirit and their ultimate victory had earned the admiration of the whole world. They will be a source of inspiration for the oppressed people of all countries for generations to come.</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-76"><b class="calibre9">DECOLONISATION: BREAK-UP OF EMPIRES</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<p class="noindent">By the end of World War II, European colonial empires had been weakened or destroyed by the ravages of battle, occupation, and neglect. The United States, committed to free and open markets, pushed its advantage at the conclusion of the peace by insisting on the dismantling of its allies’ empires as well as those of its enemies. The Soviets, preoccupied with their own recovery, were in no position to assert a global policy at the end of the war.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did Decolonisation take Place in Asia?</b></i></span> The first wave of decolonisation after 1945 had been in Asia. Nationalist movements had been growing in the 1930s, and many nationalist leaders saw the war as a catalyst for independence, especially in Asia. Great Britain knew that it no longer commanded the resources to control India, historically its richest colony, which under the leadership of Mohandas Gandhi (1869&ndash;1948) had been agitating for independence. Ultimately, British India became the independent states of India and Pakistan in 1947. Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Burma (now Myanmar) achieved full independence in 1948.</p>

<p class="caption">French Indo-China</p>
<p class="indent">In its march through Asia during the war, Japan had smashed colonial empires. Japan’s defeat created a power vacuum that nationalist leaders were eager to fill. Civil wars erupted in China, Burma, Korea, and Indo-China. Anti-colonial resistance opened the way to Communist insurgence. Indo-China declared its independence in 1945 and waged war with France until 1954. South Vietnam was declared a republic, and the United States sponsored a regime that was considered favourable to western interests. The North Vietnamese state was established under the French-educated leader Ho Chi Minh. The civil war continued, with the North Vietnamese backing the National Liberation Front in the South. After almost two decades of escalating involvement, in 1973 American troops were finally withdrawn from a war they could not win. Cold War politics had enmeshed the United States in South-East Asia and Cold War imperatives had kept it there.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did Decolonisation take Place in Africa?</b></i></span> A second wave crested and crashed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Africa, another ready battleground for Cold War dominance. During World War II, North Africa had served as a theatre of military action, while South Africa was a source of supplies and troops. Wartime experiences and rapid economic development <a id="calibre_link-567" class="calibre10"></a>fed existing nationalist aspirations and encouraged the emergence of mass political demands for liberation. A new generation of leaders, many of them educated in European institutions, moved from cooperation with home rule to demands for independence by the early 1960s. British prime minister Harold MacMillan (1894&ndash;1986) spoke of “the winds of change” in 1960, the year that proved to be a turning point in African politics. Britain and Belgium yielded their colonies. In 1960, Patrice Lumumba (1925&ndash;61) became the first prime minister of the Republic of the Congo (present-day Zaire). White European rule continued in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa despite continued world pressure. The French, having faced what its officer corps considered a humiliating defeat in Indo-China, held on against the winds of change in North Africa. France’s problems in Algeria began in earnest in 1954 when Muslims seeking independence and self-rule revolted. Although the Algerian rebels successfully employed terrorist and guerrilla tactics, European settlers and the French army in Algeria refused to accept defeat. The Fourth Republic was on the verge of collapse when General Charles <i class="calibre8">de</i> Gaulle, leader of the Free French resistance in World War II, stepped in to establish the Fifth Republic with a strong executive branch. He ended the war and agreed to Algeria’s independence, which was achieved in 1962.</p>
<p class="indent">One supporter of the Algerian revolution, Frantz Fanon (1925&ndash;61), was working as a French-trained psychiatrist in Algeria when the revolution began. In his writings, especially his book, <i class="calibre8">The Wretched of the Earth</i> (1961), he argued in favour of national liberation movements and for the necessity of violence. Fanon described the trap of dependence of colonised countries: “We go on sending out raw materials; we go on being Europe’s small farmers; we specialise in unfinished products.”</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What were their Problems?</b></i></span> Decolonisation meant continued dependence for many Third World countries, as they were now known. First World nations were identified as the advanced industrial countries; Second World countries were those whose lower level of prosperity indicated a transition from agricultural to industrial production. Third World nations were suppliers of raw materials and food to the countries of the First World. These countries were no longer directly controlled as colonies but continued to be dominated by the western capitalist powers and Japan, on whom they relied for their markets and trade. As Frantz Fanon had described it, ‘these newly independent countries had to continue doing what they had done as colonies: supplying raw materials to their former masters.’</p>
<p class="indent">African leader Kwame Nkrumah (1909&ndash;72) of Ghana denounced this situation of dependence as ‘neo-colonialism’ and called for a united Africa as the only means of resistance. Nkrumah argued that ‘aid’ was merely a ‘revolving credit’ plan that returned increased profits to the former colonial masters while extracting wealth from African nations. He led Ghana in a policy of non-alignment in the Cold War. With Jomo Kenyatta (1894&ndash;1978) of Kenya, he founded the Pan-African federation, which promoted African Nationalism.</p>
<p class="indent">Soviet leader Joseph Stalin limited the Soviet Union’s foreign involvement following the Second World War to communist regimes that shared borders with the USSR in Eastern Europe and Asia. After Stalin’s death in 1953, the Soviet Union turned to the Third World. Former colonies played an important new role in the Cold War strategies with the accession to power of Nikita Khrushchev (1894&ndash;1971) in the mid-1950s. The Soviet Union abandoned its previous caution and assumed a global role in offering ‘friendship treaties’, military advice, trade credits, and general support for attempts at national liberation in Asia, Africa, and Latin <a id="calibre_link-568" class="calibre10"></a>America. Cold warriors took advantage of Tribalism and Regionalism, which mitigated against the establishment of strong central governments. Military rule and fragmentation often resulted. Instability and acute poverty continued to characterise former colonies after emancipation, regardless of which camp the new leaders joined.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-79">UNIFICATION OF EUROPE</h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the immediate aftermath of the World War II, it was clear that there were merits in handling the problems cooperatively and through international organisations. European countries had been victims of competitive nationalistic rivalries. The post-second World War scenario was no longer suitable for any country to have its way. The ensuing Cold War was compelling countries to take sides willingly or otherwise. After the devastation of World War II and especially with the enhanced threat of atomic weapons, the international quest for peace appeared even more imminent.</p>
<p class="indent">In the fifth and sixth decades of the 20<sup class="calibre13">th</sup> century, several cooperative and international organisations were formed. Some of them were military types, such as NATO (an alliance of the USA, Canada, and non-Communist nations of Europe) and its counterpart, the Warsaw Pact (an alliance of the USSR and the Communist nations it dominated in Eastern Europe). The rest were economic in nature, and include the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (for coordination among recipients of Marshall Plan funds) and the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance (the Soviet counterpart of the Marshall Plan). The most crucial of these organisations were the serious attempts for integration in Western Europe and in the United Nations.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1949, a number of Western European countries took the first step towards political integration by setting up the Council of Europe. Many wished that it would grow into a parliament of Europe with real political power. However, the big European nations had been averse to give the council considerable power, and it continues to be an organisation of potential rather than reality.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-571" class="calibre10"></a>However, Western Europe had been more successful in moving toward economic integration. In 1950, France and Germany established the French&ndash;German Coal and Steel Authority. In 1952, it was transformed into the European Coal and Steel Community with the inclusion of Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. In 1957, these six countries signed the Treaty of Rome setting up the European Economic Community (the Common Market). Its aim was to eliminate tariff barriers, remove restrictions on the flow of labour and capital, and, in general, integrate the economies of the member nations. It was an amazing success in the 1960s because of eliminating tariff and immigration barriers well ahead of schedule, even while its member nations enjoyed relative prosperity. In the 1970s and 1980s, other nations joined the Common Market: Great Britain, Ireland, and Denmark in 1973; Greece in 1981; Portugal and Spain in 1986. Though sometimes additional steps towards integration have become difficult, in 1986, the Common Market consented to remove almost all economic barriers among member states by 1992. This agreement is expected to create a single market of some 320 million people.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">What is NATO?</b></i></span> The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is a regional military organisation formed in 1949 to give mutual security for its members in the North Atlantic region. Its 14 members (Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, West Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxemburg, Holland, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, and the USA) utilise it as a framework for cooperation in military, political, economic and social matters.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00069.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">NATO Expansion in Europe</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="calibre_link-572" class="calibre10"></a><img src="images/00096.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="indent">The association was primarily meant to prevent the threat of Soviet military aggression in Europe by combined conventional forces and by providing Western European States the protection of the American nuclear deterrent. Its political&ndash;military structure has been a useful instrument for resolving many of the issues that have cropped up within the alliance, concerning the reconciliation of the foreign and defense policies of fourteen sovereign nations.</p>
<p class="indent">In the 1960s, France pulled out her troops from the integrated NATO command and also her navy from NATO Operational Control. Though France kept her commitment for united action against an aggressor, her actions effectively removed her as a member of NATO. In the 1970s and 80s, however, the alliance has been adversely affected by a growing polycentrism, American preoccupation with Middle East affairs, disagreements over nuclear strategy and policies and an increasing sense of independence in Western Europe.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did European Community Evolve?</b></i></span> The much discussed and desired European integration received further momentum in the post-war period. Appreciating that Europe needed the full cooperation of all its members for becoming competitive in world markets, associations committed to integration began to materialise alongside economic planning mechanisms. Despite not being a supranational body with its own authority, the Council of Europe advocated a federation of European states. However Britain opposed all efforts to develop structures of loose inter-governmental cooperation.</p>
<p class="indent">Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg became the first European states to create an economic unit &ndash; Benelux. They removed internal custom duties among themselves and erected a common external tariff barrier. In 1950, the Schuman Plan brought France and West Germany together in economic cooperation by pooling all coal and steel resources. The formulators of the plan, Jean Monnet (1888&ndash;1979) and Robert Schuman (1886&ndash;1963) of France, viewed it as the initial step in the <a id="calibre_link-573" class="calibre10"></a>process of removing all economic barriers among European states and as a move toward final political integration.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1951, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, West Germany and the Netherlands established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). Despite facing relentless domestic opposition on nationalist grounds, the ECSC managed to establish a ‘common market’ in coal and steel among its member states. In 1957, these six countries founded the European Economic Community (EEC) and dedicated themselves to widening the integration of markets. Thus came into existence the so-called Common Market.</p>
<p class="indent">The Common Market was meant to facilitate among its member states a free movement of labour and capital, the removal of restrictions on trade, common investment practices, and coordinated social welfare programs. National agricultural interests were to be safeguarded. With Great Britain becoming a member of the Common Market in 1973, all European nations jointly started defining common economic policies.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why and how did European Union Emerge?</b></i></span> The European Community was set up in 1967 by bringing together the three transnational European bodies &ndash; the European Coal and <a id="calibre_link-574" class="calibre10"></a>Steel Community, the European Economic Community, and the European Atomic Energy Community. It came to have its own commission, parliament, and council of ministers, but could hardly control the operations of member states. In 1974, a ‘European Council’ was established within the European Community. It was made up of heads of government who met three times a year. From the beginning, the European Community has been dedicated to European integration.</p>
<p class="image1"><img src="images/00123.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p class="caption">European Community in 1994</p>
<p class="indent">In 1985, the European Community succeeded in passing the Single European Act, which by 1987 had been ratified by the parliamentary bodies of all the member nations. The crucial final steps were undertaken to create a fully integrated market by 31 December, 1992. The 12 members of the European Community wanted to remove internal barriers and to establish a huge open market among the member states with common external tariff policies. Additionally, the removal of internal frontier controls with a single-format European Community passport was proposed to make travel easier and to evade shipping delays at frontiers, thereby lowering costs. The aim was to make the European Community think and act as a single country. Comparisons were made to the 50 individual American states participating in one nation.</p>
<p class="indent">By 1989, around 320 million European citizens belonging to the 12 countries formed the European Community: the original Common Market six countries (France, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Italy) were joined by Britain, Denmark, and Ireland in 1973, Greece in 1981, and Portugal and Spain in 1986. Plans for European economic integration got intensified in October 1991 when the 12-nation European Community and the seven nations of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) came together to establish a new common market to be called the European Economic Area. The EFTA countries that joined forces with the EC consist of Austria, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Several of the EFTA nations wished to join the EC as well.</p>
<p class="indent">The European Economic Area constituted the world’s largest trading bloc, stretching from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean and boasting of around 380 million consumers. The EFTA nations consented to accept EC’s plans for economic integration and adopted the vast array of laws and regulations that governed the European Community.</p>
<p class="indent">The European Community plan mainly aimed at the adoption of a single currency (based on the European Currency Unit) by all the member nations. Meeting in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in December 1991, the heads of the 12 EC countries decided that a common currency, the ECU, presently known as the Euro, would replace the national currencies of eligible nations by 1997 and not later than 1999. Further, a single central banking system, called the European Monetary Institute, would commence operations on 1 January, 1994, for helping member nations in reducing inflation rates and budget deficits.</p>
<p class="indent">Economic union would be followed by political union, with member states sharing a common European defense system and common social policies regulating immigration and labour practices. Soon three East European states &ndash; Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary &ndash; were admitted with the status of associate members.</p>
<p class="indent">A united Europe, boasting of the world’s largest volume of trade and highest productivity, was expected to become a formidable presence in the world arena. With the end of the Cold War as well as the bloc politics of East versus West, the move placed Europe at the centre of world politics. However, by the mid-1990s, roadblocks slowed the move toward European integration. The Great Recession of 2007&ndash;08 and the subsequent Euro Zone Crisis further put question marks on the future of European integration.</p>

<p class="caption">Growth of European Union from 1951 to 1997</p>
<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-80"><b class="calibre9">COLLAPSE OF SOVIET UNION (1985&ndash;91)</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">General Survey</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">From the 1930s and to the 1970s, the economy of the USSR had been dominated by heavy industry and the military &ndash; production with a lot of steel and cement. It was a ‘command’ economy, controlled by a central planning commission. Agriculture was chiefly collective, with farm workers being permitted to have small private plots. The technical education was emphasised, with the Soviet Union turning out engineers in great numbers, along with scientists, doctors and other professionals.</p>
<p class="indent">Although by 1938 Soviet manufacturing had jumped to 17.6 per cent of the world share (behind a 28.7 per cent share for the United States), from 1960s there were doubts about future growth. USSR had suffered the loss of 26 million people in World War II, but by 1970, its population reached 228 million, up from 190 <a id="calibre_link-576" class="calibre10"></a>million in 1937. It accounted for one-sixth of the land area of the world, while its arable land was equal to that of the United States and Canada combined.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, it was endowed with abundant natural resources, and had been producing more oil, natural gas, iron, coal, lead, nickel, silver, copper and zinc than any other country. It possessed the largest long-range fishing fleet and was second in the production of gold and chromium. In the mid-50s, it was the most advanced nation in rocketry. In 1957, it became the first nation to send a satellite into space, and in 1961 sent the first man into space.</p>
<p class="indent">During this time, Soviet economy’s Gross National Product (GNP) was growing at about six per cent per annum. Around this period, global growth rate was also high. By 1960, USSR could account for 12.5 per cent of the world’s production (manufacturing and agriculture), which was just under half that of the United States (25.9 per cent) and the European Economic Community (26 per cent). These figures more or less would continue till 1970, whereas Japan’s share jumped from 4.5 per cent in 1960 to 7.7 per cent in 1970.</p>
<p class="indent">From the 1960s Soviet manufacturing started witnessing a shift in work. It was more toward the production of consumer items. From 1966 to 1970 under Leonid Brezhnev the GNP grew at 5.3 per annum, but between 1971 and 1975 the GNP growth fell to 3.7 per annum. After 1975, it fell to a growth of 2.6 to 2.7 per cent per year. Unfortunately for USSR, the global growth during these years was rapid, with the average annual rate hovering around 6.2 per cent. The Soviet Union was simply falling behind the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why and how did Soviet Union Decline under Brezhnev and Others?</b></i></span> The new regime under Brezhnev wanted Soviet citizens to be as prosperous as those in the capitalist countries. In order to produce more for consumers, it tried to incorporate western innovations, but could not keep up with sophisticated techniques in computers, software and communications electronics or the design and manufacturing of automobiles. Stalin’s command economy was so rigid that it was not suitable for the rapid ideas and fast changing technologies that had been developing in free enterprise economies. The biggest customer for Soviet manufacturing was the military which continued to monopolise its most skilled people to the detriment of production for civilians.</p>
<p class="indent">In the USSR, there were no individuals wealthy enough to bankroll a new business with a new idea. Central government had the monopoly of investing not only in the military but also in social programs, while money to modernise manufacturing was non-existent. There was no competition to the managers at various production plants and their thinking was not geared to consumer choice. Instead of the consumers, it was bureaucrats who were deciding what was to be manufactured. During the 1970s, low morale among the workers was hurting its economy. Cynicism and alcoholism was rampant among Soviet workers. There was much criticism among commoners towards people in power for not responding to their needs.</p>
<p class="indent">The Soviet agricultural sector was also similarly inefficient. Up to Brezhnev era, farming continued to be mostly collective. A mere four per cent of Soviet Union’s arable land was farmed as privately owned plots, but it produced almost 25 per cent of the entire agricultural output. From being one of the world’s greatest food exporters before World War I, it had now become one of the greatest importers of food in the world. After decades of collective farming, agricultural workers, like their industrial counterparts, had developed poor work habits. With distribution and transportation being a major problem, harvests frequently rotted on their way to market. <a id="calibre_link-577" class="calibre10"></a>Occasionally almost 40 or 50 per cent of a crop would perish in the fields.</p>
<p class="indent">USSR’s energy use had also not been efficient either, with scarcer supplies of fuel being added to the cost of production. A fall in sales of its oil abroad and the procurement of food from abroad were adversely affecting trade imbalance, which was costing the Soviet Union hard currency and gold. Consequently, government agencies were resorting to more deficit spending than bureaucrats were admitting. Naturally such increases in the printing of money were causing a rapid decline in value of Soviet money &ndash; the ruble.</p>
<p class="indent">In the midst of all depressing trends, ironically, there was unprecedented growth in Soviet bureaucracy and Communist Party &ndash; with many Party members working in bureaucracies. Keeping up were the number of vacation residences, pensions, perks and privileges for Party members. From the commoner’s point of view, corruption was increasing along with economic stagnation.</p>
<p class="indent">Brezhnev’s death in November 1982 led to the succession of Yuri Andropov, who attacked the moral rot on several fronts. He launched a campaign against corruption and alcoholism, imprisoning people who should have been at work but were in drinking places and criticising their managers for poor supervision of their work force. He experimented with the issue of incentives and decision-making for enterprise managers with little success. Andropov died after only 13 months in office, and was replaced by Konstantin Chernenko who also died in harness barely after a year.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did Gorbachev Try to Implement Glasnost?</b></i></span> Mikhail Gorbachev, who became the General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1985, believed that more Liberalism was the solution to the Soviet Union’s socio-economic problems. By now the Soviet economy came to have a negative GNP. In other words, instead of growing more slowly than others, Soviet economy was in decline. Gorbachev was keen to demonstrate that Socialism could adapt, innovate, and be as productive as Capitalism.</p>
<p class="indent">Having firm conviction in Socialism, Gorbachev strove to tinker with the Soviet economy rather than radically change it. He believed that reducing corruption would help and condemned ‘unearned incomes’. In order to improve the Soviet workforce, he started another crackdown against Alcoholism. Still having faith in central planning, he wanted to improve the efficiency in central planning management. Economic planning was sought to be made more effective and efficient by setting up new super-agencies to supervise economic developments.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to facilitate rapid economic growth, Gorbachev pushed for mass participation, higher morale among the work force, and more freedom and openness &ndash; <i class="calibre8">glasnost</i>. He considered the economy to a family’s home, and democracy to ownership of the home. To enable freedom of expression, he started releasing political prisoners. Andrei Sakharov, the father of the Soviet Union’s hydrogen bomb and the most outspoken dissident, was welcomed back to Moscow from exile in the city of Gorky.</p>
<p class="indent">The new regime permitted openness in newspapers and on television. Consequently, Gorbachev’s popularity was rising among the masses, whereas a few anti-Communist observers in the USA were describing Gorbachev’s policies as merely cosmetic. Believing that drastic cuts in military spending were necessary to improve the economy, Gorbachev allowed military spending decline with the general economic decline. He even surprised Americans by accepting disarmament proposals that they had put forth merely as a bargaining ploy. To top it all, Gorbachev won the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p class="indent">The Chernobyl nuclear disaster on April 25, 1986, killed hundreds of women and children, polluted rivers and streams and destroyed local agriculture. The whole episode was captured <a id="calibre_link-578" class="calibre10"></a>and transmitted to the world by a French satellite, destroying all hopes of nuclear energy as an inexpensive source of power. Although grain harvests were good during 1986&ndash;87 that permitted a reduction in grain imports, the Soviet economy continued to decline. To counter reduced oil sales abroad, the government cut down imports of consumer goods.</p>
<p class="indent">No doubt the incomes of consumers had been steadily increasing. Yet with hardly anything on the shelves for people to buy, and too much money chasing too few goods, prices started spiraling. It was exactly in contrast to what Capitalist nations had experienced in the Great Depression, when the main issue was too little money in the hands of consumers relative to what was available. Deficit spending, which was a major solution during the Great Depression, was for the Soviet Union a disaster. To make up for the inadequate tax revenues, the government continued to print more money.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">Why did Gorbachev’s Perestroika Fail?</b></i></span> Gorbachev made big plans for the so-called <i class="calibre8">perestroika</i> or ‘restructuring’ of the economy. New bureaucracies were set up to supervise planning and investments. Orders were passed for producing quality goods. New laws were enacted permitting more initiative by managers. Cooperatives of producers were allowed, along with joint ventures with foreign companies. However, none of these were bound to turn the economy around.</p>
<p class="indent">With these new bureaucracies, the Soviet economy became even more of a tangle of confusion. After half a century of being dictated to do things, and scared to take responsibility, managers were not willing to take full advantage of production opportunities.</p>
<p class="indent">Before 1986, USSR had been frowning upon China’s economic reforms. Now with Soviet Union staring at a crisis, new interest was being expressed in Chinese developments. Soviet economists started speculating as to why Chinese reforms were faring better than Soviet reforms. A Soviet economist even grumbled that ‘Chinese worked hard while Russians talked hard’. One important difference was that China’s reforms took place in the rural areas with peasants resorting to free enterprise with confidence.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1988, Gorbachev launched some political reforms. He weakened the power of the Central Committee Secretariat and removed the Party from overseeing the economy, leaving this to local soviets. He also made preparations to withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan. By the close of 1989, all the Soviet republics had acquired their own parliaments, with their own presidents. However, tensions in the Soviet Union had peaked. The deteriorating economy was causing frequent strikes by labour, and there were instances of ethnic violence, with people in some of the Soviet republics attributing their misery to the Russians.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Baltic region, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were making a move toward independence. Decades of Russian control had not been able to erase a desire for self-rule among these peoples. By now, Soviet hegemony was practically evaporating in Eastern Europe. The year 1989 proved to be momentous with freedom breaking out in the Warsaw Pact (or satellite) nations. It was also the year that the Berlin Wall was torn down.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did the Soviet Union Breakup?</b></i></span> More than anything else, Gorbachev desired to preserve the Soviet Union, but events were taking Soviet Union in a different direction. In the 1990 parliamentary elections in the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, overwhelming victories were scored by parties favouring independence. Most importantly, Russia led by Boris Yeltsin, was also on the way to independence.</p>
<p class="indent">Gorbachev was trying to steer a middle ground for which he was criticised by both the reformers and conservatives of the Communist Party. For majority of them, Gorbachev appeared <a id="calibre_link-579" class="calibre10"></a>weak and unable to make up his mind. The continuing failure of the Soviet economy was squarely blamed on him.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Gorbachev’s popularity in the West was at an all time high in 1991, his endorsement rating in the USSR was at an all-time low. This was not only because of the economic situation but also because of the fall of Communism in the satellite countries. Many Russians were blaming Gorbachev for allowing German unification again (October, 1990).</p>
<p class="indent">The new freedom that was permitted by Gorbachev was now destroying him. Observing the crumbling power of the Soviet government, he turned his strategy in the direction of preservation. He indicated to the conservatives that they were free to resort to whatever emergency action was necessary to preserve the Union. Consequently, they obliged him by staging the so-called coup in August</p>
<p class="noindent">1991, while Gorbachev was vacationing in the Crimea. Coup leaders claimed that Gorbachev was ill. Playing along, Gorbachev pretended that he was under house arrest.</p>
<p class="indent">Shocked by the coup, Russians resorted to protest in the streets. Crying for the protection of democracy, Yeltsin marched with people against the coup. The armed forces were easily persuaded to side with Yeltsin and the people. Coup leaders did not believe in the coup to such an extent that they would resort to military action against people.</p>
<p class="indent">The Communist Party of Russia was banned by a presidential decree, and by year end, the other former Soviet Republics followed the Russian Republic into independence. All Soviet embassies and consulates abroad became Russian embassies and consulates. With this, Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a legal entity.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="calibre_link-81"><b class="calibre9">POLITICAL CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE AFTER 1989</b></h3>
<p class="line1"></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How was Eastern Europe in Early 1989?</b></i></span> The East European socialist economies had been similarly affected like that of the Soviet Union. Even in Hungary, which was one of the more economically advanced satellite nations, as much as 25 per cent of the population was living below poverty line. Gorbachev announced in the United Nations his intension to pull Soviet troops out of Hungary. This was welcomed by the Hungarians, who demanded freedom to create independent political parties.</p>
<p class="indent">In Czechoslovakia, the Communist government’s judicial system prosecuted the playwright Vaclav Havel and sentenced him to remain in prison until September or October. Other Czech dissidents were also being tried and sentenced. With the growing unrest, the government realised that leniency would be prudent and accordingly acted by releasing dissidents.</p>
<p class="indent">The Polish Communist regime as well had been compromising with public opinion. Unable to suppress the dissident movement called Solidarity, it tried to absorb Solidarity into a legitimate part of national affairs. When the Solidarity leaders cooperated with the Communist regime, their candidates were allowed to contest in the elections. Solidarity became the first freely elected opposition party in a country with a Communist regime. Some American anti-Communists had been arguing that Communists would never liberalise <a id="calibre_link-581" class="calibre10"></a>voluntarily and hence had to be forced. Now they were being proven wrong.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><b class="calibre3">State of Eastern Europe in Late 1989</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">By early July of 1989, Gorbachev announced that the Poles and Hungarians were masters of their own destiny. He advised that Communist leaders in the Warsaw Pact countries should try to retain power by being good Communists with mass support. He was of the opinion that the Warsaw Pact countries were not worth hanging onto, that they were draining the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="indent">In Hungary, Communist leaders were able to see their future clearly and started replacing conservative leaders by younger and more liberal ones. The Communist Party changed its name to Socialist Party declared itself a republic. Hungarians were now free to travel abroad without any special permission. President Bush, who was on a visit to Poland, also visited Hungary and assured economic help.</p>
<p class="indent">The above developments inspired people in neighbouring Czechoslovakia. On 21 August 1989, in celebration of the 21<sup class="calibre13">st</sup> anniversary of the <i class="calibre8">Prague Spring</i> against Soviet tanks rolling into the city, former Communist leader, Alexander Dubcek, spoke encouraging words to the crowd. Czech Communist leaders were more conservative than were those in Hungary. Believing in ruthless repression, they began imprisoning protestors and rounding up dissidents, including Vaclav Havel.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did the Berlin Wall Fall?</b></i></span> The wave of freedom touched East Germany as well. The Eric Honneker regime there, however, got increasingly upset with Gorbachev’s liberalisations, and since 1988, Soviet publications had been banned in East Germany. However, it was all futile. For, East Germans had been free to travel within the Warsaw bloc and that is where many of them usually had their annual vacations. Several Germans desiring to go to West Germany crowded into the West German embassies in Prague and Hungary, demanding entry into West Germany. The exodus of Germans from Hungary into Austria multiplied by thousands, and the East German Communist regime panicked because of the loss of educated and talented young people.</p>
<p class="indent">In mid-October 1989, the Politburo in East Germany shunted out Eric Honneker with the hope that this would quell dissent. Honneker’s successor proved to be an equal hardliner, and the dissent continued. Pressurised by a far more mutinous public, the East Germany regime finally tried appeasement and reduced the contradiction between the Party line and public perceptions by publicly admitting that its regime was not popular.</p>
<p class="indent">On November 9, 1989, the Communist regime further appeased the public by announcing liberalised travel regulations. The East Berlin public interpreted this to mean that they could travel freely into West Berlin. A large mass crowded the border crossing points. The overwhelmed guards had no option than letting the joyous crowd pass. The freedom to cross into West Germany further inspired East Germans, and the Communist regime capitulated to an aroused populace. In November, 1989, the Berlin Wall came down to everybody’s surprise.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="font"><i class="calibre8"><b class="calibre9">How did Czechoslovakia and East Germany Change?</b></i></span> In Prague, however, the strategy of Communist leaders continued to be that of repression. In mid-November, after four days of demonstrations, the police physically attacked demonstrators. The following day, the demonstration attracted 10,000 strong crowd. This inspired a bigger demonstration by an estimated 200,000 people. Encouraged by resignation of the Czech Communist Party leader, an estimated 500,000 people marched for the end of Communist Party rule.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally millions of Czechs went out on a two-hour general strike to express solidarity with the demand for political freedom. In response, the Communist regime pledged free elections within a year. In early December, the Politburo admitted that the Soviet invasion had been a mistake and conducted elections within a few days. By the end of December, Czechoslovakia had a new parliament. Its president was Vaclav Havel, and the chairman of parliament was Alexander Dubcek.</p>

<p class="caption">Political Changes in East Europe</p>
<p class="indent">The East Germans promoted a reformminded Communist, Hans Modrow, to power, and under him, the Communists continued to appeal to the public. In a Party congress, many Communists confessed their mistakes and preferred a complete break with the Stalinist past. Hans Modrow promised free elections for May, and the Communist Party changed <a id="calibre_link-583" class="calibre10"></a>its name to Reformed Party of Democratic Socialism. In the elections that were held March itself, the Reformed Party of Democratic Socialism met a humiliating defeat. The new government of East Germany began lobbying for unification with West Germany. The unification of Germany was formally achieved in October 1990.</p>
